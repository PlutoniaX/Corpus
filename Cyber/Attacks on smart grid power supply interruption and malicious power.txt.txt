This paper, published in the International Journal of Information Security in 2019, reports on an investigation into power supply interruption and malicious power generation attacks on smart grid systems, focusing on both process and network vulnerabilities. A vulnerability assessment was conducted on a fully operational electric power testbed, and the discovered vulnerabilities were then exploited to perform different types of power supply interruption and malicious power generation attacks. The attacks were executed using control code modification and portal manipulation. The paper is useful for researchers and smart-grid operators to design and develop effective protection, detection, and response mechanisms.

CPSs (Cyber-Physical Systems) are systems controlled by a combination of computation and communication infrastructure and are commonly found in modern technology such as cars, airplanes and critical infrastructure. They often integrate embedded computing technology into physical systems and can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Researchers are currently investigating challenges and focusing on the importance of cyber-security in these systems, specifically in smart-grid systems.

This work aims to study the security of a physical smart-grid system developed based on modern industrial standards, and identify common vulnerabilities that may be overlooked due to a standard operating procedure in the smart-grid domain. The goal is to evaluate the defense mechanisms in a physical testbed. The work includes an experimental investigation into the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Electric Power and Intelligent Control (EPIC) testbed, the design and launch of attacks using multiple procedures, and the analysis of the impact of attacks on EPIC. The focus is on distribution systems and individual components that are more vulnerable than the highly secured transmission systems and identifying overlooked vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

This paper discusses the vulnerabilities and potential attacks on smart-grids, particularly the distribution systems with multiple energy sources. The authors investigate both network and process vulnerabilities to design attacks, including the manipulation of PLC logic, modification of SMA portal settings, and communication channel manipulation. They also present a testbed called EPIC and discuss experiments and analysis of reported attacks. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work and conclusions.

This text discusses the potential impacts of power supply interruption attacks on various sectors, including healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. The author mentions recent incidents, such as the Ukraine power blackout, which affected over 200,000 civilians and the economic impact of power supply interruption on industrial sectors. It also states that attacks on power supply availability could have even more fatal consequences when they affect the health sector as most of the medical devices as well as storage of medicines often need uninterrupted power supply. The text also mentions that water distribution, transportation and communications are inter-dependent on the power supply availability, and that an attacker could target individual organizations causing chaos in finance and business sectors.

The article discusses the potential impacts of power supply interruption attacks on industrial control systems (ICS) in common systems such as industries, commercial buildings, and residential buildings. These types of attacks can affect the normal operation of power generation, causing increased losses, increased aging and wear on generators, and unexpected power supply interruptions during peak load conditions. The article also briefly mentions the concept of smart-grids, which use digital communication technologies to detect and react to changes in energy usage, potentially increasing efficiency and robustness.

The article discusses the concept of smart-grids, which use digital communication technologies to detect and react to changes in energy usage, potentially increasing efficiency and robustness. It explains that smart-grids consist of distributed control systems and communication networks, and highlights the potential vulnerabilities that arise from the interactions between different components. The article also explains some key terms used in the study of power systems, such as apparent power, real power, and reactive power, and their relationship with voltage and frequency.

The power triangle represents the relationship between apparent, real, and reactive power. Mismatch in power generated and consumed can lead to instability and frequency or voltage stability issues. Control logic modifications in PLCs (programmable logic controllers) are vulnerable to tampering by attackers through physical or network access. An attacker's intent could be to launch a denial of service attack or compromise sensor and actuator readings. This paper explores the capabilities of an attacker upon entry in an operational smart-grid and the design of defense strategies.

The article discusses various ways an attacker can manipulate a smart grid system, including modifying control logic in PLCs, sensor and actuator manipulation, modifying settings in SMA (solar photovoltaic systems and energy storage systems) portal and changing communication channels. Some of the possible consequences of these actions include causing a denial of service attack, creating an imbalance in power flow, and affecting the overall operation of the inverters in the system. An attacker could have direct physical access or access through the network. The article also highlights the importance of identifying and exploring the capabilities of an attacker in order to design defense strategies.

The smart grid infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can compromise communication links between sensors and PLCs, potentially leading to component damage. Direct physical access by an inside attacker can also result in denial of service, MITM, and data injection attacks. Vulnerability assessment involves listing assets and resources in the system, assigning importance, identifying vulnerabilities, and proposing mitigation for the most serious vulnerabilities. Research by Kaspersky found that the number of vulnerabilities in ICS components is growing, they are exploitable, widely diverse, and not all of those found in 2015 have been fixed. The number of reported vulnerabilities has also increased, with 19 reported in 2010.

The number of vulnerabilities in the smart grid infrastructure is increasing, with some remaining unaddressed by manufacturers and management. Attack design focuses on identifying the parameters and limits at which the physical process becomes vulnerable and the manipulation of these parameters by an attacker to achieve specific goals such as power interruption and malicious power generation. The attacks can be executed through various threat models and the attacker's capability is classified based on their access to control logic and the ability to modify it.

Two classes of attacks, power interruption and malicious power generation, have been designed based on attacker capabilities such as access to vulnerabilities, communication channels and settings in a smart-grid. Power interruption attacks demonstrate manipulation of circuit breakers in different stages of the grid and modification of power settings. These attacks involve entering the communication network, targeting PLCs/controllers for DDoS, manipulating PLC/controller logic, and modifying settings in the SCADA workstation. The result is the ability to manipulate circuit breakers in different parts of the smart-grid to interrupt power supply.

Two classes of attacks on smart-grid systems have been designed, power interruption and malicious power generation. Power interruption attacks involve manipulating power settings in different stages, such as through PLC code alterations, setting portals, and communication channel modifications to cause power supply interruption. Malicious power generation attacks focus on manipulating the power generated by different generators, either by loading a particular generator heavily to cause damage or by affecting the maintenance schedule. The attack design focuses on disturbing the process before looking at network vulnerabilities. The goal of these attacks is to develop a defense mechanism for smart-grid components that are geographically distributed.

EPIC is a small-scale smart-grid testbed that simulates a real-world power system. It has four stages: generation, transmission, micro-grid, and smart-home. It is capable of generating 72 kV A of power and uses local generators, transformers, PV and batteries as sources of power generation and storage. The smart home stage has two load banks and is connected to two water test beds. The communication layout of EPIC uses High-availability Seamless Redundancy and Media Redundancy Protocol switches in a ring network for redundancy and follows the IEC 61850 standard for communication.

EPIC is an electrical substation and automation system testbed that simulates a real-world power system. It has two conventional generators, a 34 kW PV system, a 105 kV A 3-phase voltage regulator, two load banks, a 10 kW motor generator, molded case circuit breakers, a SCADA system and a historian. It uses PCvue for programming SCADA and CoDeSys for programming PLCs. The electrical layout of EPIC includes a main power supply for driving the prime mover motors and generators, and a bus for tying together the power supply from PV and battery system. The testbed has the option for grid-connected mode and islanded mode of operations, and allows for the study of security issues related to Automatic Generation Control (AGC).

The EPIC system uses variable speed drives and PLCs to process data from IEDs and issue commands to end devices. It utilizes various communication protocols including Modbus TCP/IP, Modbus serial, IEC 61850, and GOOSE. Vulnerability assessment is performed by identifying assets and resources in the system. The SCADA workstation in EPIC is vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit, while PLCs are vulnerable to outdated SSH servers and multiple vulnerabilities in dropbear that can allow remote attackers to upload arbitrary code and local attackers to access process memory. IEDs are located in the control center and protect different parts of the system using IEC 61850 protocol.

The EPIC system uses various assets and resources such as SCADA, PLCs, IEDs, VSDs, PV and battery inverters, network switches and access points. The firmware and control logic of these assets are updated through dedicated ports and access is limited to authorized personnel. There are no reported vulnerabilities in firmware and control logic of IEDs. However, during maintenance periods, unauthorized access to network control panels could lead to modifications that could impact physical safety of the process. The SCADA system is running on a Windows 7 machine and PLCs use Modbus TCP/IP communication in some cases, IEDs use SIPROTEC relays from Siemens and communicate using IEC 61850 standards. VSDs are used to control the speed of motors, PV and battery inverters use SMA products and have a dedicated SMA cluster controller, network switches and access points use HIRSCHMANN.

The article discusses the vulnerabilities present in smart grid systems, specifically in variable speed drives (VSDs) and PV and battery inverters. These vulnerabilities include the ability for an insider with access to the SCADA workstation to upload malicious code, vulnerabilities in Modbus TCP/IP protocol and Hirschmann switches, and the ability to exploit the EternalBlue vulnerability to gain access to the SCADA workstation and change power settings. The article also mentions vulnerabilities identified by ICS-CERT in generic ICS/SCADA systems.

The article discusses several vulnerabilities in smart grid systems, specifically in Microsoft Windows, Dropbear SSH, PLCs, and CoDeSys. These vulnerabilities include the ability for a remote attacker to execute malicious code, gain administrative access to the control logic in PLCs, and execute commands via the command-line interface. The article also mentions the use of default passwords by manufacturers and the failure of operating management to change them, which can be exploited by attackers. It also mentions that similar attacks to the WannaCry ransomware attack have been studied in the automotive sector and are seen as an emerging threat to critical infrastructures and ICS.

7CoDeSys is a programming environment for controllers such as WAGO PLCs. EPIC, an assessment carried out, identified vulnerabilities in the system that can be used to modify the functions of the overall control system, leading to power supply interruption attacks by manipulating circuit breakers and their status. A total of 16 attacks were designed and can be launched at different stages using four different parameter manipulations. The attacks are based on the assumption that the attacker uses vulnerabilities such as EternalBlue, SMB, and CoDeSys to compromise the network and can modify and upload PLC code into different PLCs.

The report describes a total of 16 attacks that can be launched on the EPIC system by manipulating circuit breakers and their status. The attacks are designed based on the assumption that the attacker uses vulnerabilities such as EternalBlue, SMB, and CoDeSys to compromise the network and can modify and upload PLC code into different PLCs. The attacks can be launched at different stages (generation, transmission, micro-grid, and smart-home) and using four different parameter manipulations (modifying PLC code, launching DDoS attacks, Man-in-the-Middle attacks and modifying power settings in web portals). The attackers are assumed to be already inside the network.

The attacker modifies the power setting in SMA portal to trip the whole system and executes a DDoS attack on the MPLC, Smart-home (S) PLC code of SPLC, causing the breakers CB9 to CB12 to trip. False indications are sent to the SCADA. Vulnerabilities, such as a Dropbear SSH vulnerability and unauthenticated command-line access in CoDeSys, are exploited to enter the system and manipulate the respective control tags, including mutating data across communication channels and PLC logic manipulation. Experiments A, B, C and D are conducted to manipulate PLC code, render PLC non-responsive, launch a MITM attack and exploit vulnerabilities in Windows 7 OS to perform DDoS and/or modifications on the web portal. The result is a power supply interruption attack.

In this experiment, the attacker's intention is to interrupt power to critical loads by opening circuit breaker CB12 and others. The attacker uses the EternalBlue exploit to enter the SCADA workstation and CoDeSys to upload malicious control code into the SPLC, which causes the circuit breaker to open immediately after a close command is executed, disabling further close commands and giving a false close status on the SCADA screen. This results in a power supply interruption to the critical loads as seen in the SCADA screenshot where the meter shows zero voltage. This experiment was repeated for all the cells.

The article describes experiments conducted on power systems using a DDoS attack on communication channels to flood PLCs with UDP packets, causing the circuit breaker to trip and preventing operator control. The experiment also shows how knowledge of network vulnerabilities can be used to manipulate power settings and interrupt power supply. Various methods of attack, including modifying PLC code and power settings in an SMA portal, were tested and results are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. The results show that the attacks were successful in tripping the system and causing power interruption.

The article describes experiments on power systems where different types of attacks, such as DDoS and modification of PLC code, were used to manipulate power settings and interrupt power supply. Results of the experiments are presented in Table 4. The article also notes that certain stages of the power system, such as the transmission stage, do not have any generators and therefore no components for modifying speed/power settings. Web portal-based power settings are only available for PV/battery inverters, and therefore are not applicable in other stages.

An experiment was conducted to test the vulnerability of a transmission and smart-home system to attacks. The control logic of the generators was modified and vulnerabilities in the Windows 7 operating system were exploited to manipulate the PLC code, causing a power supply interruption. Results showed that the power sharing between the generators was affected by the manipulation of the PLC code. The experiment also highlighted the need for secure access controls and regular updates to address vulnerabilities in the system.

An experiment was conducted to test the vulnerability of a smart grid system to power supply interruption attacks. The attack scenario involved manipulating the power settings in the PLC code of one generator, causing it to supply more power than the other generator and disabling the power sharing process. This resulted in the overloading and eventual tripping of the affected generator. Another experiment was conducted where the maximum power setting in the SMA web portal for the PV/battery inverters was changed, which resulted in power supply interruption to critical loads. The results of the experiments highlighted the need for secure access controls and regular updates to address vulnerabilities in the system.

In an experiment, the vulnerability of a power system (G1) to trip under overload during peak load conditions was increased by using the EternalBlue exploit to enter a SCADA workstation and adjusting the power setting to 125% for critical loads. This resulted in G2 being unable to share power and the system tripping due to power imbalance. The tripping event occurred when the battery was fully charged and solar irradiance increased beyond the load demand. Figures were provided to show the tripping event in the SMA portal and the time-domain response of the process with negative real power flow.

In this experiment, the goal of the attacker is to manipulate the power generated from a particular generator by overloading it in order to offset the maintenance schedule and cause accumulated damage in the long run. The attack is divided into two types: attacks on real power generation and attacks on reactive power generation. The attack on real power generation involves controlling the speed of the motor to change the frequency of the generator and shift the load to the attacked generator, overloading it. Two attacks were designed and launched on EPIC using this method and the attack could be launched in two different ways. The experiment focused on attacks on real power generation and did not discuss attacks on reactive power generation.

The article discusses an experiment on a smart grid system where two generators, G1 and G2, are connected to a load and share power equally during normal operation. The experiment tests an attack scenario where the speed of one generator is reduced by a certain factor, disrupting the power sharing process and potentially causing power supply interruption. The article notes observations made during the normal and attack scenarios and mentions that the attack was executed in reverse logic for safety reasons.

The article discusses an experiment on a smart grid system where two generators, G1 and G2, are connected to a load and share power equally during normal operation. The experiment tests an attack scenario where the synchronization process of one generator is disrupted, resulting in G1 supplying more power and a delay in the synchronization process. The article notes observations made during the normal and attack scenarios and provides a summary of the attacks analyzed in the work, including factors such as difficulty level, impact, time required, and potential consequences. The article also mentions that the attack was executed in reverse logic for safety reasons.

The difficulty in launching an attack on a smart grid depends on various factors such as the stage of the attack and the targeted component. Attacking secure systems like generators controlled by professionals is difficult, but attacking individual loads like those in a smart home is easier due to less protection and non-professional management. Modifying the code for changing breaker status is easier than changing power settings of a generator. Impact of an attack varies depending on the stage in the power grid.

An attack on the generation stage of a smart grid has a higher impact than an attack on a smart home, as it affects the overall system and connected systems. An attack on a micro-grid can also affect the stability of the system. The time to perform an attack varies, with attacks on generators and transmission stages resulting in a complete blackout. The impact of an attack on individual loads depends on the operating pattern and the time when power is needed. The time to realize an attack can be immediate or sufficiently long.

The article discusses the potential impact of Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on solarPV systems due to their intermittent nature. The attacker would need high computation capabilities to successfully launch MITM attacks. Feasibility of other types of attacks depend on the use of standard cyber-security protocols by the targeted entity. Studies could be useful for operators of industrial control systems (ICSs) to re-evaluate cyber-security scores with respect to IT standards. Even with state-of-the-art ICT used for power system operation and control, there may be unexplored vulnerabilities that could be exploited through weak passwords or social engineering.

The article discusses the need for frequent evaluation of industrial control systems (ICSs) against evolving vulnerabilities in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) domain. Previous work in this area includes modeling and analysis of attacks, such as deception attacks, and surveys on ICS privacy, safety, and security. Resilient control is an essential requirement for the control system that manages a Smart Grid. Researchers have also reported case studies on power substation networks, highlighting the importance of understanding the physical process limitations for improving security in ICSs.

The literature on power systems and smart-grid systems is also studied, including data integrity attacks on real-time pricing, false data injection attacks on AGC and state estimation, and control frameworks using digital signature and time stamping for authenticating control commands. Additionally, the authors also discuss the conceptual expansion of real-time monitoring systems, detecting anomalies, analyzing the impact of attacks, and mitigation.
