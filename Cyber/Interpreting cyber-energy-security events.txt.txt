The article discusses the perception and development of cyber security policy in the energy sector in relation to spectacular cyber-incidents. It specifically focuses on the 2016 CrashOverride cyberattack on Ukraine's grid and examines how the event shapes public perceptions about the dangers of digitalization in the energy sector. The authors hypothesize that the interpretation of such incidents is influenced by socio-technical imaginaries of the energy sector and security imaginaries linked to foreign policy. They analyze four discourses that emerged among Western experts and commentators regarding the Ukraine attack, and published the article in the Journal of European Security.

The article discusses the evolving concept of energy security, which has expanded to include the security of digital and complex energy systems. It mentions a potential cyber attack that could take out the grid, contaminate water, and hold hospitals to ransom. The article also notes that some cyber attacks, such as Russia's "CrashOverride" and "Industroyer" have had a greater impact than others and only the more alarmist discourses had a visible impact beyond niche communities. The article was written in 2022, and it was published by Informa UK Limited.

The article discusses the concept of cyber security in the energy sector and how it is becoming more important as digital innovation increases. It examines the 2016 cyber attack on the Ukrainian power grid, known as CrashOverride/Industroyer, which was linked to Russian intelligence actors and caused a short blackout. Despite the relatively insignificant impact of the attack, it played a large role in shaping experts' understanding of countermeasures, policymakers' response to cyber threats, and society's perception of cyber security. The article aims to understand how experts interpret cybersecurity incidents and how those interpretations affect the understanding of the insecurities of the energy system. The article was published in a journal called European Security in 2022.

This text discusses the intersection of private sector expertise and the development of cyber-security policy, specifically in relation to the energy sector. It adds to existing literature on the socio-technical practice of cyber-security politics and speaks to the growing field of critical infrastructure security studies. The text also examines how expert analysis is used in public discourse and offers a theoretical framework drawing on the technopolitical role of experts and the concept of social imaginaries. The text then goes on to analyze an incident and how it was interpreted by private security firms in 2017.

This text discusses the growing importance of cyber security in the energy sector as energy systems become increasingly digitized and distributed. It mentions the use of technology such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems and smart grids, and how these new technologies make energy systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. The text also notes that research in the field of energy security studies is lagging behind in terms of understanding and addressing cyber security threats and that existing approaches tend to focus on the material and institutional aspects of energy supply chains.

As energy security debates evolve away from physical supply and scarcity and towards low vulnerability of energy systems, the opportunity for integrating cybersecurity concerns opens. Security Studies research on cybersecurity has shifted from a focus on digitalization risks and doomsday scenarios to more granular investigations, such as the dynamics of cyber-securitization. The literature is starting to explore the relationship between the social construction of threats and the inanimate objects of cybersecurity, and the overlap between energy security and cybersecurity. Another related literature has examined the critical role of experts, often located in the private sector, in making sense of and developing digital and energy policy.

The combination of energy and cybersecurity concerns makes for a niche in societal security filled by many private companies and consultants. Research has primarily looked at various governance arrangements, the role of the private sector and the epistemic community of cyber experts in maintaining security. Attention has shifted recently towards the role private companies play in shaping how cybersecurity is understood, by investigating the practices involved in the attribution of cyber incidents. As technical knowledge to interpret cyber-energy incidents is limited, statements and analysis by industry experts are crucial to inform policy and shape the public understanding of these incidents. Cyber-energy security is a political issue where experts play a central role in providing authority and legitimacy to certain frames and understandings. Recent scholarship has put the political role of such cyber experts at the center of analysis, highlighting their importance in the making of cybersecurity.

This article examines the role of cyber experts in understanding and interpreting cyber security incidents in the energy sector. It looks at how a single incident, and the malware at the heart of it, becomes understood and interpreted by a small expert community and how these representations are filtered through various actors. The article uses a theoretical approach and method to understand the process of explaining and interpreting these events and looks at the experts and their representations of the incident, nested in broader structures of knowledge on the cyber and energy sectors. It builds on the concept of social imaginaries, such as socio-technical imaginaries of energy futures and security imaginaries of national pasts, to theorize the systems of meaning from which specific representations emerge.

Cybersecurity professionals have significant roles in shaping domestic and foreign policies. They act as interpreters of complex systems and their expertise is enhanced in times of crisis. During emergency situations, experts explain what has happened and what should be done next, and provide means to identify what is dangerous. The power and legitimacy of security experts rests on the urgency of security incidents that they identify and represent. Experts become "professionals of unease."

Experts' interpretations of incidents and their effects on society may not always align with their intentions. The authority of experts is not absolute and requires acceptance by a broader audience. Portraying experts as having complete control over how incidents are framed can obscure internal tensions within expert communities. The impact of experts on political discourse should consider their role in framing incidents and their limitations in controlling how those frames are used. Social imaginaries are pre-existing structures of meaning that influence experts' interpretation of incidents and how they are received by audiences.

Social imaginaries are collective systems of meaning that enable interpretation of social reality. They allow for creative reinterpretation of the past and envisioning of the future. There are specific types of imaginaries relevant for analysis like socio-technical imaginaries (STI) and security imaginaries. STIs are collectively imagined forms of social life and social order that center on the design and fulfillment of scientific and technological projects. They shape social responses to innovation and change and are reproduced and re-articulated by technocratic experts. STIs also have the potential to inform (de)securitization processes by warning against risks and hazards that might accompany innovation. They activate collective consciousness and help create political will to attain the STIs.

Security imaginaries are collective meaning structures that help make sense of social reality in foreign policy and state security. Cyber-energy security is stretched between socio-technical and security imaginaries, as it involves known and measurable impacts and risks, but also the relative novelty of cyber-security threats and the perceived technical nature of the issues. Translating incidents relies on metaphors, analogies, and cognitive hooks to catch the attention of the public. There remains a persistent concern over disasters in cyber-security discourses, making socio-technical and security imaginaries vital.

The article uses discourse analysis to understand the perceived threats and risks stemming from digitalization. It argues that social imaginaries are not fixed and that there are more than two possible representations of cyber-incidents. The article uses discourse analysis to study the language used in reports and articles about a specific cyber-incident (CrashOverride) to understand the elements of socio-technical and security imaginaries that underpin them. The goal is to show how discourse matters for political practice, policy change, and state action. The authors used data scraping and media analysis tools to identify critical texts and reports, and focused on two specific reports and influential articles published in June 2017 as the core of their analysis.

A study was conducted using 180 texts from 20 influential online news outlets to analyze the socio-technical and security imaginaries of cyber and energy through a method called elastic discourse analysis. The corpus and subsequent analysis have an anglophone bias due to language proficiency limitations and selection criteria of media centrality, but it is argued that this bias is justified for the context of the study, which focuses on the technical effect of reporting on the public discourse of cybersecurity. The findings apply to the European cyber-security context as well. The study analyzed the 2016 power outage in the Kyiv region caused by the CrashOverride malware.

A power outage occurred in the Kyiv region in December 2016 and was immediately speculated to be the result of a digital operation. It was later confirmed to be a cyber attack, similar to an attack on Ukrainian power stations the previous year. The incident was seen as fitting within the pattern of previous incidents in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which has been dubbed a hybrid war due to the use of unconventional means. Two independent reports were published in June 2017, one by the Slovak cyber-security firm ESET and one by Dragos, that provided details and technical specifications about a new type of malware used in the power outage.

Two cyber-security companies, ESET and Dragos, published reports on the same malware, named Industroyer by ESET and CrashOverride by Dragos. Both reports emphasized the sophistication and novelty of the malware and its potential threat to critical infrastructure. ESET's report focused on potential scenarios while Dragos' report emphasized the need for adaptation by defenders. Both reports emphasized the need for increased security measures for critical infrastructure systems worldwide.

Two private security companies published reports on an incident involving malware and its potential impact on critical infrastructure, which became the accepted depiction of the incident. The reports were widely referenced and reinforced by mass media, cybersecurity institutions, and experts. These depictions of the incident eclipsed the actual power outage in significance and generated divergent policy representations. The reports and their interpretations became the primary sources of knowledge about the incident, and were widely adopted by public cybersecurity agencies and security companies. The US Computer Emergency Response Team issued a warning for the public referencing the reports, further legitimizing the analysis for a wider audience.

Cyber-experts at Dragos and ESET established the 2016 Ukraine malware incident as a worsening security problem, represented as an accelerating race towards disaster in the digitalizing energy system. This representation allows practitioners to focus on the trend as the real problem, instead of the incident itself, and highlights the growing sophistication of malicious actors in targeting critical infrastructure. The imagined trend is seen as a potential cause of a more dangerous future and is based on the techno-politics of digitalization and the perceived intention to cause more harm.

The second representation of the 2016 Ukraine malware incident views it as the tip of the iceberg, suggesting that a real cyberwar is yet to come and that the incident is only a small part of the capabilities of militaries and intelligence agencies. This representation sees the malware as existing in an ambiguous state between offense and defense, and as a signal of far-worse capabilities that are unproven and not-yet-utilized by malevolent actors. This representation is based on the meeting point of socio-technical imaginaries of the expanding cyber-network and power grid and security imaginaries that portray developed societies as vulnerable to unexpected attacks from malicious actors. Both reports conclude that the incident was likely a proof of concept or a large-scale test, rather than a fully-capable attack.

The severity of malware is linked to the actor who created it, with advanced actors having capabilities beyond what is publicly known. Some representations of a cyber-energy incident play down the danger, emphasizing the built-in resilience of modern infrastructures and the improving security of the grid. These representations suggest that the end is not near and that future technologies will lead to a secure and resilient grid, rather than a catastrophic incident. This view is prominent in the Dragos report, which also attempts to downplay concerns.

The representation argues that security technologies and professionals can ensure that security is maintained and that the incident should not drastically alter perceptions. It highlights the challenges of constructing malware that can cause widespread blackouts. Additionally, it draws upon positive depictions of the security expert community and its ability to prevent incidents. The incident is also tied to ideas of the motives and operations of the Russian Federation, which cast it as part of a Russian grand strategy and as an element of an ongoing interstate conflict. This interpretation brings to the fore questions of Russian agency and national interests, and the issues of intentionality and broader strategy.

Digitalization plays a crucial role in enabling wargame scenarios, and the interpretation of a cyber attack known as CrashOverride through the Western security imaginary often assumes a broad strategic vision. However, some scholars and commentators have argued that this assumption of a long-term strategy is misleading. In public discourse, the incident was portrayed as a game changer and as a part of a trend towards future cyber incidents causing widespread harm. This perception of cyber-energy-security as a rapidly evolving concern led to discussions of a future where cyber gangs hold cities' power grids for ransom.

The incident known as CrashOverride was widely portrayed in media coverage as a test for a greater attack that could cause physical destruction by targeting multiple points in a power grid. The notion that the attack was supported by a nation-state and that it was traced back to actors tied to Russian intelligence gave further credibility to this narrative. However, the representation of the grid as resilient and defendable was largely omitted and counterclaims that the malware's likely scenarios would result in only hours or days of outages were left out of the discourse. As a result, calls for continued investment and attention to the insecurity of the energy grid were made based on a widely held notion of the digitalized energy system as particularly vulnerable and threatened.

This article discusses how the 2016 Ukrainian power grid blackout caused by malware was understood through different expert representations and the role of collective imaginaries in shaping these representations. Four different representations were identified, with three being dystopian and one being positive. These representations are used in policy discourse around the incident, but mainly those framing the incident as severe and calling for immediate policy action were embraced and reinforced in coverage and policy.

This discussion highlights that the representation of the 2016 Ukrainian power grid blackout caused by malware was influenced by experts, but the audience may not adopt the interpretation the experts desire. Experts within the information security community attempted to put a positive spin on the incident by highlighting the role of improved security practices in limiting the impact, but these representations did not gain traction. The narrative that took hold instead was that of urgency and emergency, which may have exaggerated the severity of the problem and reinforced a sense of helplessness in confronting the issue. This can lead to a problem of making reality appear more dangerous than it actually is, and losing key nuances in the process.

Energy security and the negative effects of relying on coal are concerns, and the 2016 cyber attack served as a wake-up call for the cybersecurity sector. Researchers should study the social construction of cyber security, the role of single incidents, and how incidents are understood differently in different societal contexts to understand the build-up and political role of transnational networks of experts.

This work is supported by the Norges forskningsrd, and the authors do not report any conflict of interest. The paper discusses the social construction of cyber security, and the role of critical infrastructure and objects of protection.
