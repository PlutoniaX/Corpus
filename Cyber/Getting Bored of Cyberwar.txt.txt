This research studies the role of civilian participation in the Russia-Ukraine cyber conflict, specifically focusing on the narrative of a cyberwar fought by committed civilians and volunteer hacktivists linked to cybercrime groups. The study collected data on web defacement attacks, DDoS attacks, and announcements from a volunteer hacking discussion group for two months before and four months after the invasion of Ukraine. The findings indicate that the conflict briefly but significantly caught the attention of the low-level cybercrime community, with notable shifts in the geographical distribution of both defacement and DDoS attacks. However, the role of these players in so-called cyberwarfare is minor, and they do not resemble the hacktivists imagined in popular accounts. There is no evidence of high-profile actions, and interest in carrying out defacements and DDoS attacks dropped off after just a few weeks.

The article discusses expert predictions about the involvement of civilian and volunteer hacktivists in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It states that their involvement appears to have been minor and short-lived, and unlikely to escalate further. The article also mentions the thirty-year history of speculation about how cybercrime techniques such as DDoS attacks and web defacement could allow civilians to play a role in a hot war between nations, and how the Russia-Ukraine conflict provides an opportunity to assess this in practice.

The article discusses the predictions that youngsters would join the IT Army of Ukraine, a group set up by the Ukrainian state to coordinate volunteer hacktivists and civilians to help disrupt and attack Russian assets, and that there would be a real cyber war with escalating hacktivist attacks on Russia throughout 2022. The article examines the role of civilians in the Ukraine cyber conflict so far, using quantitative measurements and analysis of discussions from a pro-Ukraine volunteer group, as well as interviewing individuals responsible for a significant number of defacements targeting Russia or Ukraine. The study finds that alarmist predictions of civilian participation have not come to pass, and challenges the narrative of a cyberwar producing organized, motivated, and technically skilled civilians and volunteer hacktivists.

The study by Anh V. Vu in 2022 found that cyberwarriors used trivial attacks to take down minor targets and became bored after a couple of weeks. The data and scripts used in the study are available to researchers through the Anonymised Centre. The study was approved by an institutional Ethics Review Board and a dashboard to monitor country-based defacement and amplified DDoS attacks over time is available at http://cyberstrikes :live/. The study also found that before the invasion, the US accounted for 44.63% of web defacement attacks and only 0.75% targeted Russia, while on the war day, those numbers were 24.94% and 15.36%, respectively.

The study found that there is little empirical academic research looking at the relationship between armed conflicts and cybercrime, but some have been conducted in the private sector. Information warfare has long been a routine part of armed conflict, especially around controlling communications. Cryptography has thousands of years of history, and it's contemporary usage in the NATO context includes a range of offensive cyber operations. An association between kinetic warfare and nationalistic cyberattacks has been reported, with various information operations. It also mentions that censorship is often used during wartime, governments block access to global services, especially social networks, news, and media platforms to suppress unwanted narratives. Additionally, it is reported that groups identifying themselves under the banner of the Anonymous movement declared a cyber-war on Russia with attacks against a Russian target.

This text discusses a group of volunteer hackers from the IT Army of Ukraine who instigated DDoS attacks on Russian systems, including the Ministry of Defence database and state TV channels. These attacks were significant enough that many important Russian websites adopted additional DDoS protection measures and in some cases restricted access to just Russian IP addresses. The focus of the text is on the hypothetical volunteer army of low-level cybercrime actors and their offensive tools for launching attacks, specifically web defacement. The text also mentions a non-hierarchical online social movement called the IT Army of Ukraine, which has been involved in political activism and online mischief using cybercrime techniques like DDoS and defacement. Finally, the text provides a table of web defacement archives for the 6 months from January to June 2022.

The article discusses DDoS attacks and web defacement as types of cyberattacks used in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These attacks were instigated by volunteer hackers from the IT Army of Ukraine, and were aimed at Russian systems such as the Ministry of Defence database and state TV channels. The attackers used off-the-shelf tools and simple exploits to alter website appearance and deliver political messages and propaganda. DDoS attacks were also launched to flood targets with unwanted traffic and prevent them from servicing legitimate users. The article also mentions that the attackers used online defacement archives as a "hall of fame" to show off their achievements and gain reputation. The research uses a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data with qualitative research.

The study uses three quantitative datasets to measure the role of web defacements and amplified DDoS attacks in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The datasets cover a period of six months and include data from popular defacement archives such as ZONE-H and ZONE-XSEC. The study also includes interviews with participants involved in these attacks to understand how the conflict influenced their activities. The study focuses on civilian and volunteer attackers and does not cover state-level attacks.

The study uses data from popular web defacement archives, such as ZONE-H, ZONE-XSEC, HAXOR-ID, DEFACER-PRO, and DEFACER-ID, to collect information on web defacements in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The process of collecting data includes using web scrapers to visit the archives, ensuring data completeness, and bypassing challenges such as CAPTCHA and IP blacklisting. The study relies on the consistency of the notifier, the handle used by the defacer, to differentiate between different attackers. The study also considers snapshots of defaced websites to be reliable, as they are captured at the time of reporting and may contain hidden messages with political and ideological propaganda. The study excludes DEFACER-ID from its collection due to its unreliability, as it has low volume and no reliable validation of its data.

This text discusses the process and methods used to enhance the reliability of data collected from online archives of website defacement incidents. The authors note that there are several limitations in the data, such as lack of verifiability, missing snapshots of defaced websites, and difficulty in determining victim geolocation. To improve the reliability of the data, the authors perform semi-automatic validation of on-hold reports, de-duplicate across and within archives, and correct typos in attacker identities. They also analyze the validity rates of different archives and find that some have high validity rates while others have lower rates.

This text discusses the data sources used for a study on website defacement and amplified DDoS attacks. The authors use data from online archives of website defacement incidents, which they validate and de-duplicate to improve reliability. They also use data on DDoS attacks gathered by a honeypot network deployed worldwide since 2014, which records victim information but not attack origin. They also mention the use of messaging apps such as Telegram and Wickr for co-ordinating cybercrime activities.

The Ukrainian government called on pro-Ukraine hackers to join the IT Army of Ukraine to support the war effort by attacking Russian infrastructure using a range of attack vectors, mostly DDoS. The IT Army of Ukraine uses a Telegram channel to recruit and encourage individuals with relevant skills, whether legal or criminal, to collaborate in these attacks. The channel has over 230,000 subscribers and provides access to guides and tools for launching DDoS attacks. The IT Army of Ukraine has claimed to have successfully targeted Russian banks, exchanges, and cinemas and suggests new methods of attack, such as the use of VPNs, when defensive measures are taken. Telegram is extensively used for communication among Ukrainian civilians.

The authors of the text used Telethon and Pyrogram to collect data from the official Telegram channel of the IT Army of Ukraine from its creation until June 30, 2022. They used this dataset to track the choice of targets and cybercrime activities of volunteers as the conflict progresses. They also conducted interviews with website defacers, two participants from teams responsible for defacing many Russian and Ukrainian websites, in order to gain a qualitative understanding of defacement activities and motivations, how they shifted over time, how victims are selected and the impact of the conflict on choice of targets. The interviews are presented as a way of gaining insights from individuals involved directly in the generation of the data and to help interpret the movements and associations between and within the measurement datasets.

The study used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze the behavior of black-hat hacking teams. Participants were recruited from social media accounts of defaced websites and were members of two teams supporting different sides (Russia or Ukraine). The researchers used a semi-structured interview schedule and followed strict protocols for safety and privacy. Ethics approval was obtained from the institution and informed consent was obtained from participants before the interview. Interviews were conducted via text chat on Telegram.

The study conducted interviews with two participants who were members of black-hat hacking teams. One participant was part of a Kurdish team that targeted government and business websites for political reasons, and had links to Kurdish nationalism. The other participant was a member of a Brazilian group that initially targeted Brazilian websites, but then escalated to other countries, focusing on government and educational sites. The study also collected evidence of web defacements, DDoS attacks, and information about involved actors as the war progressed, using only validated attacks and normalizing timestamps to UTC.

It appears to be a mix of gibberish and references to DDoS attacks targeting Russia and Ukraine in March 2022. The text mentions that the attacks were short-lived, with a big wave against Russia followed by a peak in Ukraine a few days later. There are also references to figures and red stars, but it is not clear what they represent.

The article discusses a study on the patterns of web defacement and DDoS attacks on Russia and Ukraine during a six-month period. The most active four-week period, around the invasion day, was analyzed hour-by-hour. The results show that Russia was the first to be targeted by these types of attacks at scale, followed by Ukraine a few days later. However, after a few weeks, the number of attacks returned to pre-war levels. The number of defacements targeting Russia peaked on the invasion day, with a majority caused by a single defacer. There were also smaller waves of attacks on the following two days. The number of defacers targeting Russia peaked two days later, with an increase in the number of attackers. Ukraine also experienced similar patterns of attacks.

There was a peak of 69 web defacement attacks against Russia and Ukraine two days after the invasion, with the largest wave occurring at 7PM on 26 February. The number of defacers targeting Ukraine peaked on 27 February with 9 active defacers. These results show a short-lived increase in targeted attacks against these countries directly after the invasion. There was a decline in DDoS attacks globally one week after the war began, but attacks thrived globally in March before returning to their previously stable state.

DDoS attacks targeted Russia and Ukraine during the 6-month period from January to June. The peak in defacements targeting Russia occurred on 25 May with 771 attacks by one attacker who had compromised a server hosting 760 websites. The peak in defacements targeting Ukraine on 1 February was caused by four defacers and did not lead to a sharp increase in the number of defacers. DDoS attack activity lagged behind defacement by about a week. Russia saw the most DDoS attack activity starting on 2 March with a peak on 6 March, while Ukraine saw significant activity a week later starting on 10 March. High levels of activity continued through March for both countries.

In 2022, there was a significant increase in the number of cyber attacks against Russia and Ukraine following a war. However, these numbers were relatively small compared to attacks happening elsewhere in the world. The majority of defacements and DDoS attacks occurred in the United States, followed by India and Indonesia. Russia and Ukraine accounted for only a small percentage of overall attacks. There is a correlation between web defacements and DDoS attacks, with many of the top countries for defacements also being top countries for DDoS attacks.

In the last two weeks of March 2022, there was an increase in cyber attacks globally, with many defacements targeting the US and unprecedented volumes of DDoS attacks targeting Bangladesh. The number of attacks dropped significantly on certain days. The DDoS and web defacement data sets are collected independently and it is necessary to control for factors such as overall internet activity before drawing significant conclusions. A peak in DDoS attacks was observed globally in the aftermath of the war. There are notable differences in web defacements between the top-country global scale and the Russia-Ukraine scale. The US is consistently the largest target, but only accounted for 24.94% of defacements on invasion day. Historically, Russia and Ukraine have accounted for a smaller percentage of targets even in the context of local peaks in activity.

A study found that a change in the way defacers chose their targets was precipitated by the war in Ukraine. While defacements and DDoS attacks increased globally in March, this was not observed for Russia or Ukraine. The study found that key actors in the defacement community played central roles and a small number of actors were often involved in many activities. The defacement community was highly centralized, with 10 defacers accounting for 26.48% of attacks over 6 months. The effect was even more pronounced for defacements targeting Russia, where the top 10 accounted for 62.61% of attacks. Some key defacers picked sides, with two of the ten most prolic participating in attacks against Russia after the war began.

The study found that the conflict in Ukraine caught the attention of some prominent members of the defacement community, but also drew in new players. Some minor players at the global scale made a big contribution to the rise in attacks on Russia and Ukraine. The study found that the two most active defacers globally made only a trivial number of attacks against either country. The study also found that the motivations of defacers have already been studied at a general scale, they focused on gaining insights within the context of the conflict. The study found 980 groups of identical messages and identified the motives of each group based on the messages meaning. They found that the political sentiment in the messages was either supporting Russia or Ukraine.

The article discusses the motivations behind cyber attacks on Russia and Ukraine, and finds that most messages did not reference the war. The majority of attacks were for amusement and reputation, self-expression, or other conflicts such as Israel-Palestine. Some were financially motivated. However, some defacers did leave messages relating to the war, with twice as many supporting Ukraine than Russia. Some defacers also supported a country but defaced that country's websites to alert administrators and help secure the systems.

The article discusses the activities of the IT Army of Ukraine and their promotion of Russian targets on their Telegram channel. The targets are not limited to Russian and Belarusian country codes but also include generic top level domains. The article analyzed these announcements to explore the choice of targets and found a total of 3,845 targets promoted, including 2,291 IP addresses and 1,554 domains. The article also presents data on the number of announcements and targets in the IT Army of Ukraine Telegram channel by day.

The IT Army of Ukraine Telegram channel recorded a high number of announcements and targeted domains in the first couple of weeks after the invasion, peaking on February 27th with 40 announcements and 45 domains promoted. However, the volume of announcements quickly declined to consistently less than 10 per day after two weeks. The number of promoted targets increased, particularly in the last two months of data collection, with announcements containing multiple targets. Community engagement followed a similar pattern, with more targets promoted in the last two months. There were occasional periods of several days with no promoted targets, suggesting the organizer may have run out of new targets or lost interest.

The IT Army of Ukraine Telegram channel recorded a high number of announcements and targeted domains in the first couple of weeks after an invasion, peaking on 27th February with 40 announcements and 45 domains promoted. However, the volume of announcements quickly declined to consistently less than 10 per day after two weeks, with some days having no announcements at all. Community engagement also declined over time, as shown in Figure 7, with a decline in views, emojis, forwards, and replies. The group also provided instructions for DDoS attacks, but user engagement with these instructions decreased over time. There was also a decrease in overlap between targets promoted by the group and observed attacks.

The IT Army of Ukraine maintains a dashboard showing the status of targets, claiming many are down due to member actions. The report correlates the Telegram channels list of targets with other datasets to determine if the attacks involved reflected DDoS or if web defacers were claiming successful attacks. The report found very little overlap with defacement among 3,845 promoted targets and considerable overlap (30.86%) with DDoS attacks among 2,291 promoted IP addresses. However, these overlaps still account for a very small proportion of global DDoS attacks observed, showing a trivial contribution from the channel.

The IT Army of Ukraine announces targets on their Telegram channel that are often associated with a particular theme. These mini-campaigns are sometimes patterned around particular days of the week and are often targeted at weekends. The report suggests that there is a loss of interest by volunteers in the promoted targets as the frequency of the overlaps between the promoted targets and the actual attacks decreased from late May. The group owner posts most of the targets, but during the last two months, they often stuck to promoting old targets via links to previous posts, which could suggest difficulty in coming up with new targets. The report also found that some targets were indeed down while they were previously active, suggesting that attacks might have been successful.

The IT Army of Ukraine targets five main categories, with news, media, and propaganda being the most common, followed by government and public services, banking and finance, IT solutions and services, and logistics. These categories have been consistently targeted since the war began, with news, media, and propaganda becoming the most common in May. Government and public services and banking and finance systems have also been regularly targeted throughout, but grew rapidly towards the end of data collection period. IT solutions and services and logistics have been less frequently targeted.

This passage discusses the various categories of targets for the IT Army of Ukraine's cyber attacks, which include news, media, propaganda, government and public services, banking and finance, IT solutions and services, logistics, and others such as online markets, manufacturers and trading, education, insurance, telecommunications, businesses and state companies, discussion forums, entertainment and some non-governmental organizations. The passage also mentions that the study includes qualitative research in the competitive defacement community to explore the motivations and patterns of behavior of the attackers. The study includes case studies from two participants recruited from two different defacement teams, noting that the teams have a wider support base from a range of other countries, with a small number of official members and a larger community of supporters.

10 members, mostly young high-school and college students, with varying skill levels and history of illicit behavior, were involved in low-level cybercrime activities such as selling cybercrime services, monetizing pre-made attack scripts, and competitive web defacement. They primarily targeted public sector websites for amusement or competition and sometimes for political campaigns. They were not highly-skilled experts but rather typical participants in the contemporary industrial cybercrime economy.

Two groups of cybercrime entrepreneurs, not based in Russia or Ukraine, were involved in low-level cybercrime activities such as selling cybercrime services and competitive web defacement. They demonstrated more political interest than many in the cybercrime service ecosystem and were the sort of people targeted by Ukraine and Russia for cyberwar participation. They did not actively participate in the Telegram channel but took part in self-directed mass defacement aligned with the war, mainly for their own amusement. They obtained information about the war from social media news and changed targets specifically due to the war. They claim to be influenced by the war but remained largely financially motivated, while some teams within the competitive defacement community did attest to political motivations.

Two teams of hackers defaced news sites during the war between Russia and Ukraine, but neither had a strong political viewpoint on the war and did it for fun or as a hobby. They used traditional mass-defacement methods and ready-made tools, targeting both countries but quickly losing interest. The participants were part of a densely networked community in the cybercrime underground and cooperated on some campaigns. One participant stopped due to fear of arrest.

The study found that cybercrime communities have shifted from using underground forums to private chats like Telegram and Signal. The defacement community was influenced by the conflict in Ukraine, with some hackers choosing sides and participating in attacks, while others remained neutral. The study also found a significant but short-lived impact of the invasion of Ukraine on the activities of civilian and volunteer hacktivists. Defacement activity had an immediate effect due to the availability of existing tools, but little overlap with targets promoted by the hackers.

The IT Army of Ukraine was found to target harmless and defunct websites with Russian domain names through automatic attacks using ready-made scripts. These attacks were financially motivated and not intended to target specific victims. The rise in DDoS attacks was found to occur a week after the invasion and had a significant influence, with at least 30% of targets found in a Telegram channel also found as victims in a reflected DDoS attack database. However, the increase in web defacement and DDoS attacks was short-lived, possibly due to participants losing interest. This is in line with a trend in the cybercrime ecosystem of an increasingly service-based economy that is becoming detached from traditional hacker cultures.

The study found that the interest of low-level civilian attackers and volunteer hacktivists in the cyber conflict is fleeting and easily diverted by trending news. This combination of deviant entrepreneurship and expressive juvenile delinquency suggests that the contemporary cybercrime underground is becoming similar to classic criminological portraits of offline street-level crime and disorder. Committed, effective hacktivism appears to be separated from these low-level communities. The study also suggests that while some cybercrime-related activities are contributing to the war effort, they are few in number and have vast disparities in impact, which makes them difficult to measure and connect to specific groups or actors. The study also acknowledges its limitations, noting that datasets covering the whole cybercrime underground are not available and that the use of defacement and DDoS attacks cannot represent the entire ecosystem.

This work presents an analysis of hacktivism during a cyber war between two nations, focusing on defacement and DDoS attacks. The data used for the analysis is collected from a variety of sources, including archive websites, and the study covers a period of four months. The authors note that the participation of civilian and volunteer hacktivists in this conflict is largely trivial and that there is little measurable evidence to suggest that they are making a real contribution to the conflict. The study challenges popular narratives that tend to group state hacking, political hacktivism, and low-level cybercrime activities together.

This work presents an analysis of the role of civilian participation in nation state conflicts, specifically in regards to cybercrime. The authors found that the participation of civilian hacktivists is largely trivial and that there is little measurable evidence to suggest they are making a real contribution to the conflict. The study challenges popular narratives that group state hacking, political hacktivism, and low-level cybercrime activities together. The authors suggest that these activities are more about cultural expression and information war than hard power, and draw parallels to youth cultures that emerged during the Cold War. The study also acknowledges that what initially appears to be a large-scale movement can turn out to be the result of a small number of actors.

The article discusses the use of cybercrime and cyber attacks in the context of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. It cites various sources that report on the scale and nature of these attacks, including reports of hacking attempts on Ukrainian universities and Russian government institutions, as well as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on Russia. Some sources suggest that the threat of a full-scale "cyberwar" between the two countries may have been overhyped, while others argue that Russia is losing the information war in Ukraine. The article also references studies on police interventions in the market for DDoS attacks and the effectiveness of such interventions.

Several studies have been conducted on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cybercrime. The results of these studies indicate an increase in cybercrime during the pandemic, particularly in the areas of DDoS attacks, cybercrime marketplaces, and fraud. Studies also suggest that the pandemic has led to shifts in opportunities for cybercriminals. Additionally, researchers have examined the implications of the pandemic for cybercrime policing and have considered future considerations for addressing cybercrime during and after the pandemic.

The article discusses an increase in cybercrime since the pandemic, with specific focus on concerns for psychiatry. It also mentions DDoS attacks in Ukraine and Russia, internet activism during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, information warfare in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and governmental censorship in war-time. Additionally, it mentions the use of data-wiping malware in destructive attacks on Ukraine and the number of DDoS attacks suffered by Ukraine.

In February 2022, a group known as Anonymous declared cyberwar on Russia and targeted various Russian organizations with Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks. These attacks have been reported to be some of the most severe since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Additionally, Russian hackers have been targeting Ukrainians and European allies through phishing attacks. In response, Ukraine has seized funds from a crypto wallet that was funding Russian forces. The situation has been dubbed "Industroyer 2" and highlights the ongoing cyber tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

A group known as Anonymous has allegedly hacked the Russian Ministry of Defence and state TV broadcasts to show war footage from Ukraine. Studies have been done on hacking and web defacement, including the use of machine learning to examine cyberattack motivations, the analysis of commodity DDoS services, and investigations into web defacement campaigns. There have also been discussions about archiving hacked websites and reports on UDP amplification DDoS attacks. The Ukrainian IT army has also been reported to have been involved in cyberattacks on Russian websites.

This passage references various sources discussing the role of Ukraine's cyber army in attacking Russian cinemas and other cybercrime activities. The sources also discuss the heterogeneity of cybercriminals and the use of multi-technique approaches to predicting key actors in online gaming forums. Other topics include the structure and tasking of the IT Army of Ukraine, the concentration of cybercrime, and the methodology for identifying related accounts in underground forums.

This is a collection of references to various articles, studies, and reports on topics such as extremism, the manosphere, online forum data, cybercrime, law enforcement intervention, entrepreneurship in cybercrime, differential association and marijuana use, juvenile delinquency, cyber warfare, and web scraping laws. Some specific examples of sources cited include a preprint on "Enabling Large-Scale Research into Extremism, the Manosphere and Their Correlation by Online Forum Data," an article on "Policing the cybercrime script of darknet drug markets," and a book on "Cyber War Will Not Take Place." The sources also include online news articles and guidance from organizations such as UK Research and Innovation and the British Society of Criminology.

This is a research paper discussing the collection, sharing, and analysis of web defacement, amplified DDoS attacks, and Telegram chats. The study has been approved by an ethics committee and only publicly accessible data is collected. The use of web scraping is legal according to a 2022 U.S. court ruling and the study's scraper does not overload websites. The honeypots used in the study absorb attack packets to reduce harm to other sites.

The researchers obtained approval from their ethics committee for interviews with victims of cyber attacks and gave participants the opportunity to disclose the name of their teams. They originally limited participation to those aged 18 and over, but later obtained a waiver for high-school students. The study was aware of the potential harm to individuals and researchers, and took steps to protect participants' anonymity and obtain their consent for disclosing information. The researchers did not ask for consent from Telegram users or web defacers when using scraped data, assuming they were aware that their messages were publicly visible. The data analysis was conducted using aggregated data without identifying individuals.

The researchers made the quantitative data and code available for other researchers under a license agreement with the Anonymised Centre to prevent misuse and ensure ethical handling of sensitive data. They have robust procedures and experience in making data available in various jurisdictions. They collected web defacement data in a complete and reliable manner to measure real trends, not artifacts. They faced challenges in scraping complete snapshots at ZONE-H, including text CAPTCHA to prevent bots, limits on older data, and potential misses when visiting the dashboard infrequently. They used an algorithm for semi-automatic defacement validation which goes through all submission IDs, verifies by archives and altered by terms, and groups pending and verified attacks. The algorithm also uses the Levenshtein distance to find the most similar group and assist annotators with the final decision.

The article discusses the challenges in collecting data on defacement submissions from online archives, specifically the issue of validation. The archives use different methods for validation, such as manual review by staff or automatic validation using keywords in messages left on the defaced pages. This can lead to slow verification or errors in the validation process, resulting in incomplete longitudinal data. The authors propose a semi-automatic validation strategy that uses messages on the defaced pages to decide the validity of on-hold submissions. The goal is to enhance the completeness and reliability of the data.

The article describes a method for semi-automatically validating defacement submissions that have been put on hold by online archives. The method involves using messages left on the defaced pages to determine the validity of the submission. Common hacking terms are filtered for in the messages, and defacer's handle is also considered. Any remaining reports are then manually validated by looking for the defacer's signature. To speed up the process, candidates are grouped by handles and messages, and a web browser is used to view the defacement in case the message is not clear. The method is considered accurate and reduces the required human effort. Dynamic redirects and lack of evidence are ignored to ensure that only valid defacements are flagged.

A semi-automated approach combining automated handle similarity analysis with manual review of messages is used to unify defacements and defacers. The approach uses a Levenshtein metric to extract similar pairs of handles and then compares 10 sample messages left by defacers in each pair. The decision to unify the pair under a single nickname is based on various aspects such as message patterns, stylometry, synonyms, the inclusion of handles in the messages, typos in the handles, team, nationality, messages semantics, language, and even the rarity of handles. The messages left by defacers are diverse and may contain information such as phone numbers that can link to their country.

A semi-automated approach is used to determine the attack geolocation. This approach is challenging as IP geolocation is not always stable and trustworthy and providers prefer locating servers in countries with cheap hosting. Different archives may determine the attack geolocation differently. The approach uses data fusion to enhance accuracy by prioritizing the top-level domain, IP geolocation at collection time, and geolocation of the AS hosting the IP address. If a website's IP address belongs to a Content Delivery Network (CDN), its geolocation is determined solely by the top-level domain, as any geolocation of IP address or ASN will be unreliable. The top three CDNs are Cloudflare, Amazon Web Services, and Akamai, serving around 89% of customers.

This text discusses a study on website defacement, which found that 5.55% of defacements are hosted on four specific Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) by a certain number of prefixes. The study found that Cloudare, Amazon Webservice, Akamai, and DDoS-Guard were the most commonly used CDNs for hosting defacements. The text also mentions that the study preferred using country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) over IP geolocation to measure the frequency of website defacement in certain countries, as attackers often target websites in a country by scanning domain ccTLDs. The text also includes interview questions for individuals or teams who have engaged in website defacement, such as their demographics and organization, and the reason for their choice of online archives.

This text includes a list of interview questions for individuals or teams who have engaged in website defacement. The questions focus on their hacking activities and motivations, the use of online archives, the selection and targeting of websites, the use of automation, the involvement in other types of cybercrime, the learning of skills, the exploitation of vulnerabilities, the posting of content on defaced sites, the cooperation with other hackers, and the moral and legal perspectives on website defacement. The text also includes questions about the interviewees' political views and opinions on a specific conflict, and where they source their news and information about the conflict.

The text discusses the activities of hackers and hacker communities, specifically in relation to a potential cyberwar and their involvement in it. The writer is inquiring about the IT Army of Ukraine and whether the person being addressed is a member of the group. The writer also asks about the types of cybercrime committed by the person and their community, and if they have targeted Russia or Ukraine. The writer also inquires about other hacking groups and the possibility of future research collaboration with a university.
