The Russia-Ukraine war is an important geopolitical event that affects the formation of the modern world order and international security. Russia has used various means in the war, including hybrid warfare, cyber warfare, soft power, and symmetric threat. Cyberspace is an important aspect of modern warfare, and Russia is actively using its cyber capabilities in the war. Russia aims to restore its influence in the territories of the former Soviet Union. This article discusses the geopolitical implications and expected threats of the Russia-Ukraine war and Russian cyber attacks on Ukraine-Georgia.

The article discusses the threats and risks posed by Russia from cyberspace to Ukraine and Georgia, focusing on Russian military aggression, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the resulting threats to Ukraine and the world at large. The paper also examines the cyber capabilities of Ukraine and the role of the West in strengthening its cyber security, as well as NATO and EU policy in the development of Ukraine-Georgia cyber security in the context of risk response and management.

The article discusses the development of technology and its impact on security mechanisms, specifically focusing on the use of cyber warfare by Russia in its aggression towards Ukraine and Georgia. The authors state that Russia has not changed its strategy, but has instead added cyber warfare as an additional tool for conventional warfare, and that this has been observed for the past few decades. The article also examines the geopolitical aspects of the Russian-Ukrainian war, including the start of a war against Ukraine announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on the night of February 24.

Armed conflict is a type of armed confrontation used to resolve economic, political, national-ethnic, and other conflicts using military force. It has a limited political goal, is usually limited in scope, and does not involve the whole society. It can escalate into war and may be perceived as such by smaller countries. In the 20th century, great powers used armed conflicts for geopolitical advantages and as a testing ground for their capabilities. In the 21st century, predicting armed conflict has become more difficult due to the disappearance of restraining factors among great powers and the active use of force by new centers to gain influence in regions.

A military operation is a coordinated military action taken by a state or non-state actor in response to a developing situation, with the goal of resolving it in their favor. It can be of combat or non-combat nature and may be referred to by a code name. War, in the popular sense, is a conflict between political groups involving hostilities of considerable duration and magnitude. Sociologists apply the term to conflicts that are initiated and conducted in accordance with socially recognized forms and treat it as an institution recognized in custom or in law. Military writers usually confine the term to hostilities in which the contending groups are sufficiently equal in power to render the outcome uncertain. The actions of extremist forces and the threats of nuclear blackmail have intensified, making even armed conflict a threat to international peace and requiring active action to prevent and address them.

The Russia-Ukraine war, which began in January 2022, is a result of Russia's demand for legal guarantees from NATO and the United States that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic military bloc. Russia invaded Ukraine after receiving a refusal, seeing Ukraine's integration with the West as an existential threat to its interests and security. This war is the largest in Europe since 1945 and is affecting the geopolitical and geostrategic situation globally. Russia's actions are also changing the principles of nuclear non-proliferation, and Western intelligence agencies should be aware of the threat of its use.

The Russian-Ukrainian war poses a threat not only to Ukraine but also to Europe and international security. The use of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia against Ukraine is a concern, creating anxiety and fear among all world participants. This war has caused indecision and vigilance among countries not directly involved and led to changes in existing balances and status quo. This chaotic environment increases the threat of a third world war and nuclear war, reduces the chance of dialogue and diplomacy, and creates geopolitical rifts stretching from Europe to Asia. The war has also created problems such as strengthening of defense budgets, rapprochement of Europe, the EU, and NATO, issues of energy supply and new swap agreements, issues of Taiwan and the Kuril Islands, and consequences of sanctions.

The article discusses the ongoing Cold War between Russia and Ukraine, highlighting the use of hybrid warfare tactics, including cyber warfare and information manipulation, by Russia. It suggests that these actions are part of a larger Russian strategy and attitude towards the rest of the world, and that these problems will likely continue for a long time. The article also notes that Russia's actions have increased the geopolitical significance of Ankara to NATO.

The article discusses the ongoing information war between Russia and Ukraine, with Russia spreading propaganda about the rise of fascism in Ukraine and portraying Putin as a liberator. The article also notes that Ukraine initially resisted this propaganda but has since been hindered by conflicts with Georgia and Moldova. The authors argue that the Ukrainian government should not believe disinformation spread by certain advisors, such as Oleksiy Arestovych, and that this disinformation is also being spread against Georgia and Moldova. The article also mentions that this disinformation campaign is led by President Zelensky and is expected to continue as a threat.

The article discusses accusations of immorality and lies regarding negotiations with Russia over dairy imports, and the recall of an ambassador from Georgia. It also mentions the appointment of wanted criminals to high positions in Ukraine, and the country's deviation from the true path in the successful propaganda and information war. It also mentions Russia's continued combined military and cyber-attacks against both Georgia and Ukraine, and the need for leading countries to bring the actions of Russia into a unified system and resist it. An example of this is the largest cyber-attack on Georgia during the Russian-Georgian war of 2008.

The article discusses the use of hybrid war tactics, including cyber-attacks, in the Russian-Ukrainian war of 2014. It mentions examples of cyber-attacks on government and critical infrastructure systems in Ukraine, including the Cabinet of Ministers, energy companies, the National Bank, media, the Kyiv metro, the Ukrainian Post, and the Boryspil airport system. The article also mentions that Russia has been using Ukraine as a testing ground for cyber-attacks even before the war and that since the beginning of 2022, there have been repeated cyber-attacks on government systems following the deployment of 150,000 Russian troops along Ukraine's borders. The largest of these attacks occurred on February 16 when the websites of almost all structures were blocked. It is not clear if this was the beginning of a military war or a signal, similar to what happened in Georgia in 2008.

Russia has demanded that NATO not expand to Eastern Europe and that Ukraine and Georgia not become members of the organization. Russia believes it is being besieged and has its own unique approaches and objectives. Russia has also demonstrated potential in cyber warfare, using cyberattacks against Georgia and Ukraine in the past to expand its interests.

Russia has been known to use cyberattacks in asymmetric conflicts, and has used them in the past to test its ability to influence elections and to expand its interests in Georgia and Ukraine. The NATO summit held in Brussels in 2021 discussed Russia's aggressive policy and the threat it poses. NATO has increased its defense spending and patrols in response. The Secretary-General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, stated that the organization's goal is to protect allies and maintain peace, but in the past, it has been unable to do so in the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

NATO is focusing on reforms to strengthen cyber security and support Georgia and Ukraine in modernizing their defense and security forces. Russia is carrying out hybrid attacks in parallel with the conventional war in Ukraine. The 2008 Bucharest decision for Georgia and Ukraine to become members of NATO still stands and Russia has no right to interfere in this process. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed recognition of two separatist regions in Ukraine as independent republics, similar to the situation in Georgia in 2008. There was a continuous information war preceding the provocation and Russian TV channels and news agencies spread disinformation that the provocation was held by Ukraine, not Russia.

Cyber-attacks on Ukraine's systems preceded the full-scale invasion by the Russian army on February 24, 2022. The US, UK, and EU officially blamed Russia for a large-scale cyber-attack that disrupted the ViaSat satellite internet service an hour before the start of the war. This destroyed tens of thousands of satellite terminals. Russia has suffered significant losses in both real and virtual space during the war, including the destruction of the myth of Russia's military invincibility and cyber warfare. Russia has launched massive cyberattacks on Ukraine's strategic infrastructure since the start of the war, targeting government, financial institutions, and internet service providers. Anonymous, a decentralized hacking organization, has claimed to have infiltrated Russian Geopolitics and issued a statement on the war and expected threats.

Anonymous hackers may have infiltrated Russian security systems and extracted lists of Russian agents, which they plan to publish in stages. The extent of damage caused by these attacks on Ukrainian and Russian state websites or military systems is unclear and will likely take years to fully understand. NATO and other states and organizations provide political, humanitarian, and military assistance to Ukraine, which is important for the country's recovery after the war. The continuation of the war will physically and morally destroy Ukraine, and defensive weapons provided by NATO and the US will not guarantee victory. The authors suggest that a direct confrontation with Russia is a tactical mistake and that coordination should have been negotiated from the beginning. They also note that Georgia has been under pressure from Russia for centuries and that it is a problem for the entire world.

The authors suggest that the Russian government may use nuclear weapons as a form of intimidation, but that this may just be propaganda. They argue that the Russian leadership prefers to have territories that are destroyed and uninhabitable rather than flourishing under someone else's control. The authors believe that Ukraine is coming out victorious in the Russia-Ukraine war, but at a great cost. They argue that the involvement and assistance of the West is crucial for Ukraine's eventual victory, and will help rebuild the destroyed infrastructure and strengthen its statehood. The authors argue that the Russia-Ukraine War of 2022 has shown the true face of Russia as an aggressor and a significant threat to global security that needs to be effectively contained.
