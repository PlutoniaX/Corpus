It was published in the journal "Banks and Bank Systems" in 2021.

The article discusses the state of cybersecurity in Ukraine and the challenges faced in preventing cybercrime, particularly in the banking sector. It highlights the need for effective measures and cooperation between private and public sectors to combat cybercrime, including the classification of cybercrimes in legal acts, introduction of banking criminal law, and creation of Ukrainian cyber forces. The authors note that the rapid development of technology and increased reliance on information make cybercrime particularly attractive and difficult to detect.

The article discusses the challenges of investigating cybercrime, specifically in the banking sector, and the difficulty of detecting and recording traces of crimes in virtual space. It notes that the ability of criminals to remotely destroy traces of crime makes investigations more difficult. The authors also highlight that cybercrime is becoming increasingly international in nature and requires specialized knowledge of law enforcement officers. They propose that the issue of investigating virtual crimes in the banking sector requires specialized knowledge and resources.

This article discusses the issue of cybercrime in the banking sector and the need for international cooperation among law enforcement to minimize it. The study aims to analyze and systematize theoretical and practical measures to combat cybercrime in the banking sector in Ukraine and identify promising ways to combat cybercrime. It highlights that users of information systems often have a false sense of security and that the increasing number of internet users leads to an increase in risk factors such as society's dependence on technology and vulnerability to cyber attacks.

This article discusses the issue of cybercrime and its classification based on its role in the legal relationship between personal computers and the internet. It highlights that cybercrime can be committed easily with the help of software and forums that provide stolen credit card numbers and user credentials. The author cites the research of foreign scholars such as Brenner, who identified three categories of cybercrime: crimes in which a computer is the purpose of the crime, crimes in which a computer is used as a means of committing a crime, and crimes in which a computer plays a minor role in the crime commission. It also mentioned the German Criminal Code's concept of computer fraud and the essential elements of cybercrime in German jurisprudence, such as crimes committed with the help of statements, invasion of personal privacy, fraud, software and hardware attacks, documents forgery using a computer, and other computer crimes.

The article discusses various types of cybercrime, including fraud with goods purchased online, credit card fraud, new methods of account fraud and money laundering, advertising fraud, and click fraud. The most common crimes in cyberspace are embezzlements committed by deception, including payment fraud, skimming, malicious payment software, social engineering, phishing, e-commerce fraud, and prepayment fraud. The article also highlights the challenges of combating cybercrime, such as the blurring of lines between domestic and international information transmission and the concept of banking criminal law.

The article discusses the concept of banking criminal law and the need for further study of cybercrime investigation in the banking sector due to the rapid development of technology and new forms and methods of committing crimes in cyberspace. A study in 2017 ranked countries based on their level of security, with Singapore and Malaysia among the top countries and Equatorial Guinea as the worst country in terms of implementing the main provisions of the Global Program. According to a report by Accenture Security, by 2030 the total loss from cybercrime can amount to about USD 90 trillion. The article also highlights the importance of recognizing cybersecurity as a strategic goal to be addressed at all government levels, citing the European Commissioner for New Technologies Implementation's statement that interpreting cybersecurity as a purely technical task is a serious mistake. Ukrainian authors who have studied the criminal law and criminalistics aspects of cybercrimes in the banking sector, including Burbelo, are also mentioned.

The article discusses the legal and organizational aspects of cybersecurity in Ukraine, specifically focusing on cybercrime in the financial and banking sectors. The authors note that the majority of cybercrimes occur in these sectors and include fraud, theft of funds, money laundering, and seizure of confidential information. They also mention that many of these crimes go unreported due to concerns about customer confidence and liquidity risks. The article also mentions that Ukraine has introduced methodological materials to research computer media and support the study of software products as a means of committing computer crimes.

The article discusses the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime in Ukraine. The authors note that prosecutors have a large role in guiding the investigation and that knowledge of relevant information technology is necessary for effective procedural guidance. They also mention that cybercrime is profitable and often goes unreported by financial institutions due to concerns about reputation and costs of internal investigations. Factors such as profit, lack of reporting, and virtual environments are cited as reasons for the spread of cybercrime.

Cybercrime has specific characteristics such as the need for specialized knowledge in detecting and recording crime traces in electronic form, organization and transboundariness, high latency caused by reluctance of the private sector to report crimes, high level of technical support for criminals, and specific features in investigating cybercrime in the banking sector. The investigation of cybercrime also involves analyzing the information environment of the crime and determining the type of electronic device involved in the crime to guide the direction of further investigation.

When investigating cybercrime in the banking sector, it is important to establish the type of computer operating system and software used to commit the crime, as well as identify the hardware and software affected during unauthorized access in order to narrow the circle of suspects. Experts with specialized knowledge in software and computer technology should be involved in the investigation, and examination is a key part of the process. Experience from other countries concerning prevention, detection, cessation and investigation of cybercrime in the banking sector can also be used, and many countries have created special anti-cybercrime units to monitor cyberspace and take operational and investigation measures.

Cybercrime prevention and investigation involve providing assistance to other sectoral services and law enforcement agencies, accumulating and analyzing cybercrime information, and working with the public and mass communication. Temporary access to documents and materials may be necessary to ensure criminal proceedings during the investigation of cybercrime in the banking sector. The UN's International Telecommunication Union, a specialized agency, operates the Global Cybersecurity Agenda program which aims to maintain security and openness in the information society of the 21st century, based on five principles: legislative measures, technical and applied initiatives, organizational structuring, capacity development in the information environment, and international cooperation.

The analysis of cybercrime investigation in the banking sector shows that a new approach is needed as traditional methods are not effective. Special attention should be paid to increasing the level of professional training for relevant operational units, pre-trial investigation bodies and prosecutors. International cooperation should include creating regulations and standards, developing general recommendations, and introducing effective models of organizational interaction between states. Traditional international cooperation mechanisms are not effective in today's fast-paced digital world. The lack of qualified personnel in law enforcement agencies makes it difficult to take quick decisions in cybercrime proceedings, which also face challenges due to the shift to mobile devices and the use of closed networks.

The investigation of cybercrime in the banking sector is hindered by the covert nature of international criminal organizations, lack of an international cybercrime database, reluctance of financial institutions to disclose illegal interference, and a shortage of state experts in computer analysis. The laws and methods for investigating cybercrime need to be updated and new methods developed. Rapid and timely information exchange is crucial for increasing the efficiency of investigations and a special database for electronic evidence should be created.

The investigation of cybercrime begins when a crime is reported and enters into the Unified Register of Pre-trial Investigations, and ends with the prosecution of the offender or the closure of the case. At the pre-trial investigation stage, various measures are taken, including public and covert actions, expert investigation, and international cooperation. Cybercrime is increasingly affecting individuals' bank accounts and the number of victims is increasing due to the growth of non-cash payments. Factors contributing to this growth are the development and improvement of IT technologies, a wide geographical scope for crimes, lack of training for law enforcement officers, and imperfect domestic legislation. Ukraine needs to improve its legislation and take into account the human factor by providing training and involving IT specialists in preventing, counteracting, and investigating cybercrime.

The leading activities of software testers, system analysts, and cybersecurity specialists contribute to constant professional growth and updating of skills in line with technology changes. Interaction of law enforcement officers with IT specialists will partially solve the issue of investigating crimes in the banking sector in cyberspace. In the context of improving legal regulation of cybercrime investigation in the banking sector, it is currently important for Ukraine to adopt the experience of countries with effective cybersecurity systems. Common crimes in the banking sector include fraud using payment cards, unauthorized debiting of bank accounts, and interference with Internet banking. The practice of investigating cybercrimes in India, where professional hackers may be involved, is interesting in the context of research. Many countries now have Cyber Corps whose activities are aimed at protecting the country's cyberspace, such as Germany, Russia, Britain, Estonia, the United States, and China.

The cyber corps in Germany and Estonia consist of IT specialists whose aim is to attack and increase cybersecurity. Foreign countries are using technological solutions to combat transnational cybercrime, such as Europol's IOCTA system for detection and support for EU members through its online investigation system and crime database. Examples of transatlantic cooperation include the FBI and Dutch National High-Tech Crime Unit's operation to block Alpha Bay and Hansa Market, two leading online anonymous markets. Police agencies were able to disrupt these markets and collect valuable data from thousands of users. International cooperation in regards to cybercrime combating must involve all countries, based on the nature of the information and the crimes committed. Cybercrime legislation harmonization is necessary in cyberspace, as the nature of the crimes committed requires it.

The article discusses the importance of cyber security and the need for coordination, cooperation, and legal measures at the international level to address it. The article also mentions Ukraine's Cybersecurity Strategy, approved in 2016, which aims to improve measures for collecting electronic evidence of crime and identification and recording of cybercrime. The article highlights the need for joint efforts by both public and private entities to address cybersecurity issues, but notes that only the state can effectively counter cybercrime. The article also mentions the issue of bureaucratization in law enforcement bodies in Ukraine, which can delay investigations and potentially result in loss of evidence.

The article argues that a solution to combat cybercrime in the banking sector and improve cybersecurity in Ukraine is the creation of a special unit, cyber forces, whose activities will focus on preventing crimes in cyberspace. The article suggests that this will significantly reduce the number of fraudulent acts and crimes in banking operations. The article also suggests several key approaches that can be implemented to increase the level of cybersecurity in Ukraine, including the classification of cybercrimes in Ukrainian legal acts, establishing cooperation between banking institutions, government, and law enforcement agencies, and creating a cyber force unit to prevent and combat cybercrime.
