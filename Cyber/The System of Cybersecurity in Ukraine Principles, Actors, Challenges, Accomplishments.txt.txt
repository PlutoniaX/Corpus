This article discusses the system of cybersecurity in Ukraine and how it has been developed in response to cyberattacks. It covers the key principles of cybersecurity provision, the actors involved, sectoral policies and their measures, as well as achievements and challenges. The article also notes that a draft law on the foundations of cybersecurity in Ukraine was approved by parliament on October 5th, 2017, which is a significant milestone in the regulation of cybersecurity in Ukraine.

The article discusses the cyber security system in Ukraine and how it has shifted from a regulatory framework to a legislative one. Despite this change, the key actors and roles involved in cyber security in Ukraine remain the same. The article also notes that certain challenges in cyber security cannot be solved by a single law and require specialized measures. The article mentions a specific cyber attack in Ukraine, referred to as Petya, which affected various systems including state bodies, airports, banks, media companies, and even the radiation monitoring systems at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The attack also caused damage to many organizations abroad.

The article discusses the importance of cyber security as a national security priority, due to the potential scale of damage caused by cyber threats. It mentions the Petya malware attack in Ukraine as an example of this, with some experts believing it to be a disguised wiper rather than ransomware. The article highlights that cyber threats are relatively new phenomena that have become more prevalent due to globalization and digitalization, and notes that they are challenging to manage due to factors such as ease of execution and difficulty in identifying and bringing perpetrators to justice. It also emphasizes that cyber threats are constantly evolving and causing global chaos and panic.

The article discusses the chaotic spread of malware, specifically referencing the WannaCry attack and its impacts on various sectors and industries globally, emphasizing that cyber threats have no regards for geographical or political borders. The article then focuses on the Ukrainian example of the state's approach to cybersecurity as a sphere of national security, analyzing key principles and approaches, actors involved, policy measures, achievements, and challenges in this area of regulation. The article also attempts to clarify what the Ukrainian state sees as cybersecurity and its main features, but notes that it is a difficult task due to uncertainty in prescribed correlations between information.

The article discusses the distinction between security and cybersecurity in Ukraine. Originally, cybersecurity was seen as a part of security, which was an essential element of national security of the state. However, recently on the regulatory level, a certain distinction seems to occur. The article looks at legislation, noting that the Constitution of Ukraine does not mention cybersecurity specifically but it is considered as a part of information security. The Law On Information and Law On the Fundamentals of National Security of Ukraine also do not provide clear definition and connections between information security and cybersecurity.

The security of Ukraine includes several spheres, including external politics, state security, military and border security, internal politics, economy, social and humanitarian, science and technology, civil defense, and information. The threats connected to the sphere of information security listed in the act include limitations of freedom of speech and access to public information, dissemination of violent and pornographic content, manipulation of public conscience, disclosure of state secrets, and computer crime and terrorism. Cybersecurity is considered a part of information security by national legal researchers, and is defined as the security of information and infrastructure in the digital environment. Both information security and cybersecurity are intertwined, and threats to information security can manifest through negative informational influence.

The hierarchy of information security, cybersecurity and cybercrime counteraction is assumed, but regulations make the distinction less clear. The Strategy of National Security of Ukraine differentiates between threats to information security and threats to cybersecurity and security of informational resources. Threats to information security include conduct of informational warfare and lack of a coherent communication policy, while threats to cybersecurity and security of informational resources include vulnerability of key infrastructure to cyberattacks and an obsolete system of protection of state secrets. Similar differentiation is also noted in the Concept of Development of the Security and Defense Sector of Ukraine and the Doctrine of Informational Security of Ukraine. The latter also has an ideological angle but some provisions fall under cybersecurity.

In Ukraine, there are regulations in place for information transmission during martial law and a separate strategy for cybersecurity that covers the protection of state information resources, key infrastructure, and counteracting cybercrime. The development and security of cyberspace and electronic governance are also elements of the state policy in the area of development of informational space and society. Information security and cybersecurity are considered distinct spheres of national security, with information security focusing on the object of impact and cybersecurity focusing on the digital dimension of threats.

This text discusses the distinction between information security and cybersecurity in Ukraine. It argues that while they are related, they are not subordinate or alternative to each other. The text notes that cybersecurity is not currently defined on a legislative level and calls for further research to establish a consistent framework. In the meantime, it offers a broad definition of cybersecurity as the protection of vital interests of individuals, society, and the state in cyberspace through the use of legal, organizational, and informational measures. The text also highlights several key features of the Ukrainian state's understanding of cybersecurity, including the importance of protecting interests in cyberspace.

Cybersecurity is defined as the protection of vital interests in cyberspace, including the creation of safe conditions for state electronic information resources and information infrastructure. It is considered a key area of national security in Ukraine and is approached as a threat-based, risk-management function. A systemic approach is used, involving coordination of different sectoral policies and use of capabilities from both state and private actors.

The paper discusses cybersecurity and the measures taken to protect against threats, specifically focusing on the threats faced by Ukraine. These include the Petya malware, which affected various organizations in 2017 through trusted software and email attachments, and the energy sector, which was targeted in a successful attack in December 2015. Experts believe that the Petya malware was primarily designed to corrupt data, rather than ransom.

In Ukraine, cyberattacks on three energy companies resulted in the shutdown of 30 substations, leaving 230,000 people without electricity for up to 6 hours. The attackers used a trojan called Black energy, delivered via forged emails, to infect networks and take control of automated remote control systems to execute shutdown operations on substations. They also remotely disabled IT infrastructure, deleted data, and carried out DDoS attacks on call centers to create additional chaos and confusion. A similar attack occurred in 2016 and an attack was also carried out on Ukraine's automated election system during the 2014 Presidential Elections.

In Ukraine, there have been multiple cyberattacks on energy systems, state financial organizations, and the automated election system in 2014. These attacks have been multifaceted and aimed at achieving different objectives, and have threatened not only cybersecurity but also information security. The attacks have been complex and probably required support from a stronger power. In 2016, there have been similar attacks on state financial organizations and the identification of malware in an electronic flight control system.

The Euromaidan events that took place in Ukraine in late 2013 and early 2014 were followed by various forms of malicious cyberactivity, including blocking of mobile communications, hacking of electronic media websites and personal accounts of politicians, DDoS attacks against state bodies, and infection of information systems of state bodies, media, financial entities, and large companies with a worm called snake, ouraboros or turla. The main goals of the perpetrators were theft of confidential information and/or prolonged monitoring of said information. The acts fall under both cybersecurity and information security, highlighting the need to establish a proper relationship between the two areas on both theoretical and legislative levels. A previous event in 2012, the Ex.ua hacktivism, also demonstrated similar patterns.

A hacktivist cyberattack in Ukraine in 2012, carried out mainly by citizens coordinated by social networks and utilizing easy-to-use services like the Low Orbit Ion Cannon, targeted several governmental websites including the President, the Parliament, the State Security Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. According to official press releases, the Security Service of Ukraine detected a number of the hacks and initiated 25 criminal proceedings. However, since no direct financial harm was done to state bodies, no criminal cases were instigated and no real conclusions about the state of Ukrainian cybersecurity were made. The attack was the first major instance of a hacktivist cyberattack in Ukraine but on a day-to-day basis, numerous criminal activities commonly referred to as cybercrimes, such as cyber fraud, content-related offenses and use or selling of software designed to gain illegal access to computers and networks are taking place. Additionally, non-intentional malfunctions in automated systems also pose a threat to cybersecurity in Ukraine.

Threats to cyber security can vary in nature, be caused by different actors with different motives, and have different impacts and consequences. Classifying all incidents as cybercrimes may not be practical for addressing the issue and different approaches and measures may be needed depending on the specific threat. Examples of incidents discussed include a mass computer crash at UK airports and the malfunction of the autopilot on a cargo ship, both of which resulted in disruptions and consequences. The use of specialized counterintelligence or military actors may be necessary for some incidents, while regular law enforcement may be sufficient for others. It is important to assess the qualities of each threat and use a combination of measures and capabilities from various structures to manage the issue proportionately.

The article discusses the importance of understanding the systemic approach to cybersecurity and the need for creating templates of response mechanisms tailored to different types of threats. However, the author notes that Ukraine is still far from creating a proper typology of threats and classifying them. The article references a document that does not list specific threats, but does provide a list of measures to be carried out in the near future. The article also references two main threats to cybersecurity listed in the Strategy of National Security, which are the vulnerability of key infrastructure and state information resources to cyberattacks, and the obsolete system of protection of state secrets. The article also states that the provisions in the Strategy of Cybersecurity are inconsistent and unclear.

The violation of the modes of operation of automatized processes in key infrastructure can be considered cyberterrorism. Politically motivated attacks against government or private websites that alter information or block access to it are also a common form of cyberattack. Additionally, the development of the information society has led to the emergence of new types of cybercrime such as illegal collection, storage, use, and deletion of personal data, illegal financial operations, theft, and fraud over the internet. The categorization of cyberthreats to the Ukrainian state and society includes both classical cybercrime and cybercrimes specific to geopolitical conflicts, such as hacktivism, cyberespionage, and cyber-sabotage. The European Union's Cybersecurity Strategy also recognizes a variety of threat origins including criminal, politically motivated, terrorist, state-sponsored, natural disasters and unintentional mistakes.

The concept of cybersecurity incidents, whether intentional or accidental, is used in the Ukrainian Draft Law and the EU Strategy as a starting point for classifying cyberthreats. The EU Strategy does not provide a complete classification, but it is possible to infer categories such as threats to cyber resilience, cybercrimes, and threats to cyber defense from its provisions. The Ukrainian cybersecurity system should be established to counteract all types of threats, including those aimed at cyber defense, generic cybercrimes, and threats to cyber resilience, using a combination of measures and delegation of authority to relevant structures.

The main actors in Ukrainian cybersecurity include the Council of National Security and Defense, which coordinates and controls the activity of the subjects of the Sector of Security and Defense, the Ministry of Defense and its Department of Information Technologies, the General Staff and its Head Department of Communications and Information Systems, intelligence bodies and the SSU, law enforcement agencies such as the National Police and SSU, technical protection regulators like the SSSCIP, the private sector including electronic communication providers and key infrastructure managers, research and educational facilities, and other organizations, associations, and citizens. The Council of National Security and Defense also has a specific body called the National Coordination Center of Cybersecurity, which is responsible for analyzing the state of cybersecurity and various parameters.

The main actors in the defense and counterintelligence pillar of Ukrainian cybersecurity include the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the Armed Forces. Their main tasks include repelling military aggression in cyberspace, cooperating with NATO in cybersecurity and mutual protection from cyber threats, and protecting the informational infrastructure of the armed forces. They have specialized divisions such as the Division of Information Technologies of the Ministry of Defense and the Head Division of Communications and Information Systems of the General Staff. The National Coordination Center of Cybersecurity, under the Council of National Security and Defense, coordinates and controls their activity and also provides security recommendations, enforces rapid response protocols and measures of international cooperation to prevent the spread of cyber threats.

The Minister of Defense of Ukraine has announced the development of a new unit for cybersecurity with assistance from NATO, based on the positive experience of Lithuania. The intelligence bodies, including the Service of External Intelligence of Ukraine, the Intelligence Body of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, and the Intelligence Body of the State Border Guard, have their general legal base of functioning provided by the Law on Intelligence Bodies of Ukraine. These bodies are tasked with carrying out intelligence activity concerning threats to national security in cyberspace. The Security Service of Ukraine acts as a counterintelligence and specialized law-enforcement body with main tasks of counter-intelligence and investigative measures aimed at fighting cyberterrorism and cyberespionage. The National Police of Ukraine's functions in the area of cybersecurity include enforcement of the protection of rights and liberties of persons and citizens, and interests of the state.

The Technical Protection Regulators group is mainly represented by the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection, whose tasks include forming and implementing state policy, state control of cyber protection of state information resources, and key informational infrastructure. It also carries out organizational and technical measures of prevention, identification and reaction to cyber incidents, elimination of their consequences, providing information on cyber threats and respective methods of protection, auditing the objects of key informational infrastructure for vulnerabilities, etc. The National Bank of Ukraine is another important actor of the group, tasked with establishing requirements towards cyber protection of critical information infrastructure in the banking sphere. The private sector is not directly instructed in the Strategy, but it is acknowledged that conditions must be created for their participation in various capacities.

The provision of cybersecurity in Ukraine involves participation from non-state bodies such as organizations and research institutions, as well as cooperation with state bodies. However, public-private partnership in this area is still in the early stages of development and there is a lack of specialized research institutions. The legal framework for cooperation between state bodies and business oriented organizations also needs improvement. Law enforcement plays a limited but important role in providing cybersecurity for the state. The Security Service of Ukraine has a twofold capacity of counterintelligence and investigation, and its main legal basis for functioning is the Law On the Security Service of Ukraine.

The Security Service of Ukraine is responsible for counterintelligence and investigating cybercrime. The Unit of Counterintelligence Protection of the Interests of the State in the Sphere of Information Security is in charge of counterintelligence and the service is bound by the Code of Criminal Procedure when acting as an investigating body. The National Police is responsible for dealing with the majority of cybercrimes and has a specialized division, the Department of Cyberpolice, which focuses on preventing and counteracting criminal offenses connected to the use of electronic devices, computer networks, and telecommunication networks. The National Police is currently undergoing structural reforms and re-attestation of staff, with more reforms planned in the future.

The Cyberpolice Department in Ukraine is responsible for solving cybercrimes, conducting investigative actions, establishing and maintaining a 24/7 contact network for crime reporting, prosecution of accused individuals, and collecting electronic evidence. Additionally, it analyzes factors that lead to the commission of cybercrimes, develops legislative measures to improve legislation and other normative acts in the area of cybercrime counteraction, and carries out educational activities such as drafting professional development guidelines, community outreach and educating the public on cybersecurity issues, and participating in trainings and conferences. This department has a systemic approach to cybersecurity and carries out a diverse range of activities.

The article discusses the nature of crime-preventive functions of law enforcement bodies with regard to cybercrime counteraction, which consists of crime prevention, organization of counteraction and enforcing criminal responsibility. The author points out that only the third function lies in the field of law-enforcement powers, and the impact that the actual enforcement of the law has on crime prevention seems to be limited in this area of illegal activity. However, the author also notes that new trends in criminal legislation allow increasing the scope of the preventive functions of criminal law, and the degree of this in relation to Ukraine and its system deserves a separate in-depth analysis. The article also mentions the classification of cybercrimes according to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, specifically the offenses against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems and responsibility for this category is mainly prescribed by a separate Chapter XVI of the Special Part of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.

The System of Cybersecurity in Ukraine includes a number of crimes related to unauthorized interference in computer and telecommunications networks, including the creation and distribution of malicious programs, unauthorized access to restricted information, and violation of computer usage policies. Penalties for these crimes can include fines, imprisonment, and prohibitions on certain activities or positions. Examples of high-profile cases include the Petya malware infection, while a low-profile case is a group of individuals being charged with unauthorized access to computers.

The Criminal Code in Ukraine establishes responsibility for a number of offenses related to computer and telecommunications networks, including unauthorized interference, creation and distribution of malicious programs, unauthorized access to restricted information, espionage, treason, and illegal gathering or use of commercial or banking secrets. Additionally, the Convention establishes obligations to criminalize only two computer-related crimes: computer-related forgery and computer-related fraud. These crimes are usually qualified as multiple offenses or by attributing more value to the subjective elements as the non-Chapter XVI offenses.

Computer-related crimes are conducted through the alteration or deletion of computer data or interference with the functioning of a computer system. The responsibility for cyber fraud is prescribed in the Criminal Code of Ukraine and related offences include illegal activity with transfer documents and bank accounts. Cyber forgery is not explicitly established in the code but can be qualified under the same articles as traditional forgery. Examples of cyber fraud include creating fake online shops and receiving payment for items that do not exist. Offenses such as illegal gambling and selling narcotics can also fall under the category of computer-related crimes.

Petya infection is a malware that causes harm to certain objects, and in some cases, may share characteristics with acts of terrorism or attacks on objects that pose a danger to the environment. The Criminal Code of Ukraine does not contain special clauses for committing such crimes through the use of computers and networks. The Budapest convention lists two types of content-related offenses: those related to child pornography and those related to infringements of copyright and related rights. The Criminal Code prescribes liability for distribution of pornographic materials, including those involving minors, violation of copyright and related rights, and violations of other intellectual property rights that can be carried out with the use of computers and networks. An example of a content-related offense is the distribution of child pornography over the internet by someone who had worked as a schoolteacher.

The category of offenses known as "Acts of a Racist and Xenophobic Nature Committed Through Computer Systems" was introduced by the 2003 Additional protocol 27 to the Convention. It includes the dissemination of racist and xenophobic material through computer systems, racist and xenophobic motivated threats and insults, and the denial, minimization, approval or justification of genocide or crimes against humanity. Responsibility for these crimes is established in the Criminal Code of Ukraine, such as in articles 161, 300, and 442. However, there may be discrepancies between the characteristics of the crimes in the Criminal Code and those of the Convention. The jurisdiction for investigating these crimes falls under the National Police, but the Security Service also has a role in investigating cybercrimes.

The criminalization of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems was established in Strasbourg on January 28th, 2003. The law criminalizes acts such as the dissemination of racist and xenophobic material through computer systems, racist and xenophobic motivated threats and insults, and the denial, minimization, approval or justification of genocide or crimes against humanity. However, due to the difficulty in qualifying these relatively new categories of crimes, there is a high potential for jurisdictional conflicts which can reduce the effectiveness of this area of cybersecurity. The Code of Criminal Procedure provides for two categories of investigative activity: investigative actions and covert investigative actions. These actions include interrogations, search of property, inspections, investigative experiments, examination of a person, and carrying out an expert examination. Covert investigative actions are more directly linked to counteracting crimes related to cybercrime.

Covert investigative actions, such as interference in private communication and interception of information from telecom networks, are conducted in Ukraine when information about a crime or perpetrator cannot be attained through other means. These actions must be sanctioned by an investigating judge, with some exceptions. Telecom operators and employees are required to facilitate these actions and implement measures to keep them non-disclosed. Other types of covert investigative actions include acquiring information from electronic systems and determining the location of a radio device. The ultimate responsibility for cyber crimes is not explicitly stated, leading to competition between different agencies.

The article discusses the potential improvements to the capacity of law enforcement in Ukraine to combat cybercrime. The jurisdictional overlap and lack of clear qualification of cybercrimes as specific crimes can be addressed by changes to procedural and substantial laws, and by differentiating criminal responsibility for cybercrimes against state and other information resources. Other challenges include underdeveloped investigative powers, which can be addressed by improving methods for acquiring electronic evidence, identifying and documenting cybercrimes, and carrying out expert examinations. Additionally, Ukraine should focus on developing real-time procedural actions using electronic documents, special procedures for intercepting information from telecom channels, and enforcing obligations of telecom providers to record and store data.

The article discusses the importance of improving the capabilities of law enforcement bodies in dealing with cybercrimes, including improving cooperation, response speed, and training for electronic evidence. The article also highlights the need for drafting and implementing sectoral policy measures in order to establish an efficiently functioning system of cybersecurity. The principles guiding these measures include free access to cyberspace and protection of rights, a systemic approach, and international cooperation.

The article discusses the importance of preventing and deterring cybercrimes, particularly in relation to national security threats connected to the conflict with the Russian Federation. The article also mentions that Ukraine seeks enhanced cooperation with the EU, NATO and the international community, as seen in the Strategy of National Security and the Cybersecurity Strategy, which are based on the principles of the Budapest Cybercrime Convention and the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine.

Cooperation between Ukraine and the EU in the area of cybersecurity is mutually beneficial, as cyberthreats pose a common danger for both parties. Ukraine's information infrastructure can be used as a transit base for carrying out cyber attacks against third states, including EU members. Without a common cybersecurity policy between the EU and Ukraine, these factors will still pose their respective threats to Union states. Ukraine aims to establish itself not only as a strong independent state, but also as an equal, contributing, democratic member of the international community by forming its own integral strategy regarding cyberspace.

Ukraine should carefully evaluate and not rush into international cooperation and taking on international law obligations in order to align with its national interests. The country is in the early stages of establishing its system of cybersecurity and the measures listed in the strategy are ambitious and may take years or even decades to implement. The measures include development of a safe, stable and resilient cyberspace through drafting and implementing policies, harmonizing documents, and attaining compliance with international, EU and NATO standards.

The article discusses measures for cyber protection in Ukraine, including international cooperation, scientific and technological policies, economic regulations, monitoring and reactive measures, and social outreach. These measures aim to improve electronic communication infrastructure, protect mobile devices and information, create a competitive environment, and raise digital awareness among citizens. The article also mentions measures for protecting state information resources and restricted information, mostly involving technical measures such as creating a national telecom network.

The article discusses the measures being taken to improve cybersecurity in Ukraine, including the development of secure electronic state registries, a national system of cybersecurity, and increased awareness and training for state employees involved in cybersecurity. The article also mentions measures for the protection of key infrastructure, including the development of a normative framework and state-private partnerships for preventing and reacting to cyberthreats.

Measures are being taken by military and intelligence bodies, as well as the National Police and Security Service, to enhance the capacity to manage high-profile cyber threats and create a single Armed Forces cyber security unit. These measures also include limiting the role of organizations with ties to the Russian Federation in cybersecurity, modifying criminal law for cybercrimes, and developing research and training in the field of cybersecurity for national security and defense purposes.

Fighting cybercrime is seen as one of the categories of cybersecurity policies of a state. Measures include establishing a protocol of joint action for law-enforcement bodies, increasing the speed of response, creating a contact center for communicating about cybercrime, improving investigative powers, regulating the acquisition of electronic evidence, enforcing obligations of telecom providers to record and store data, developing the procedure of blocking an identified information resource, preparing judges and law enforcement officials to work with electronic evidence, and elevating the qualification level of law enforcement operatives. The article notes that fighting cybercrime is only one part of the larger system of cybersecurity.

The article discusses the priority cybersecurity measures that need to be adopted by Ukraine in the near future, including a system of measures found in the CNSD Decision on the Treats to Cybersecurity of the State and Immediate Measures of their Neutralization. Steps have been taken in this direction, such as the creation of an application form for reporting cybercrime on the website of the Department of Cyberpolice and a form for reporting cyberincidents on the CERT-UA website. However, the existence of duplicate contact centers raises doubts about the effectiveness of the system and shows institutional competition. A follow-up decision, adopted after the submission of the article, focuses on strengthening the protection of systems and networks of state bodies, state-owned enterprises, and key financial institutions, and expanding and modernizing the SSSCIPs regulatory authority. The new decision also requires establishing an outsourcing mechanism of certain cybersecurity tasks to private entities within the framework of public-private partnership.

The article discusses the System of Cybersecurity in Ukraine and the measures outlined in a decision by the National Security and Defense Council. The decision includes provisions for immediate activation of international cooperation by security agencies, as well as the drafting and submission of a law on differentiation of responsibility and investigative jurisdiction in regards to cybercrimes committed against state and other informational resources. The decision also includes a list of measures with set time frames for their implementation, but it seems that authorities are failing to meet many of them. The measures can be divided into several categories, including legislative and regulatory activity, with the main task set for the Cabinet of Ministers. There are also secret measures included in the decision that may be inconsistent with the principle of democratic civil control over cybersecurity.

The article discusses measures to improve cybersecurity of key infrastructure in Ukraine. These measures include setting conditions for cybersecurity of key infrastructure, establishing rights and obligations for cybersecurity subjects and owners, creating mechanisms for interaction between parties in case of cyberattacks and incidents, and setting limitations for the use of software and devices from aggressor-states on key infrastructure. The measures also include increasing responsibility for violations of regulations and non-compliance with requests from government agencies. The article also notes that Ukraine is working to comply with the Budapest Cybercrime Convention, which it initially signed in 2001 and ratified in 2005.

The article discusses measures to improve cybersecurity in Ukraine. These measures include creating protected data centers for storing state information, developing a national telecom network, and producing solutions to fulfill the needs of state bodies and companies. The article also mentions measures to enhance security in the banking and financial sector, such as establishing a legal mechanism to block electronic payment systems of aggressor-states in Ukraine, and working with government agencies such as the National Bank, SSU, SSSCIP, and the National Police to achieve these goals.

The National Program of Informatization in Ukraine is a set of projects aimed at creating, developing, and integrating information systems, networks, and technologies to support the functioning of state bodies and other organizations. The program was adopted in 1998 and has undergone changes over the years, but does not seem to be aligned with recent initiatives in national security or cybersecurity. New measures for the program, including new tasks for 2018-2020 and a roadmap of measures, are being proposed in a draft law on the state budget and a General state charter is being established to address current cybersecurity threats.

Ukraine is in the early stages of forming a cybersecurity system, which is a common challenge among world powers. Despite this, Ukraine has made significant progress in the area through the adoption of various normative documents such as the Cybersecurity Strategy, the Regulation on the National Coordination Center of Cybersecurity, and the Law On the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine. Recently, Ukraine has also implemented special sanctions directed at physical and legal persons related to Russia to address the ongoing conflict and to serve another goal.

The article discusses restrictions on Russian software in Ukrainian information systems and networks as a measure to improve cybersecurity and support national developers. The restrictions include popular social networks and services, and their impact is both positive and controversial. Some people are finding ways to access the blocked services through VPN technologies. The draft law is also discussed.

The article discusses the Fundamentals of the Provision of Cybersecurity of Ukraine (Draft law) which was adopted after first reading in September 2016, and evaluated by a committee in April 2017, but returned for further modifications before being brought to a second reading. The article notes that the normative framework for cybersecurity in Ukraine is mainly based on acts of the regulatory level, and that the draft law aims to establish a terminological base on the legislative level. It also points out that the draft law does not regulate all cybersecurity questions in detail, and it is not clear when the draft law will be adopted.

In 2014, Ukraine reported 18 million in 2017, according to RBK. The article by D. Kazanskiy further explains that the system of cybersecurity in Ukraine should focus on defining key terminology and concepts on a normative-legal level. R.V. Mukoida and A.O. Schelehov state that while Ukraine ratified the Cybercrime Convention in 2005, the normative-legal base connected to ICT crimes is still imperfect and the law uses concepts that are not defined or have inconsistent definitions. The Draft Law aims to bring clarity and consistency by defining concepts such as cyberincident, cyberattack, cybersecurity, cyberthreat, cyber-protection, cybercrime, cyberspace, and objects of key infrastructure. The Draft also establishes the principles and actors of the system of cybersecurity in Ukraine and provides for international cooperation with foreign states and law enforcement.

The Draft Law for the system of cybersecurity in Ukraine aims to establish key terminology and concepts on a normative-legal level, bring clarity and consistency to the current laws, and establish criteria for objects of key infrastructure. It also includes provisions for international cooperation with foreign states and law enforcement, as well as state-private cooperation in the area of cyberspace, which includes a system of rapid detection, prevention and neutralization of cyber threats, increasing digital awareness of citizens and involving experts, research facilities and professional associations in the development of cybersecurity projects. The main challenge in regulating cybersecurity in Ukraine is the lack of a clear normative definition.

Cybersecurity in Ukraine is a complex issue that has not yet been fully addressed in legislation. There is uncertainty in the correlation between cybersecurity and information security and a need for further research to establish a consistent legislative framework. The Ukrainian state recognizes the importance of protecting interests in cyberspace and employs a threat-based, risk-management approach to cybersecurity provision. Recent threats include the spread of Petya and WannaCry malware.

Threats to cybersecurity in Ukraine come in various forms and from various actors, with different motives and targets. These include ransomware, attacks on the energy sector, cybercrime, and incidents related to state systems and networks. A proper typology of these threats is needed to create effective response mechanisms and a systemic approach to cybersecurity provision is necessary. The article presents an attempt to classify threats into three categories: those aimed at key infrastructure or information resources, generic cybercrimes, and threats to cyber resilience.

The provision of cybersecurity in Ukraine is divided into four pillars: defense and intelligence structures, law-enforcement bodies, technical protection regulators, and the private sector. Cooperation between actors is higher when the threat of cyber incidents is greater. There is a lack of established public-private partnership and specialized research institutions in Ukraine. Law-enforcement bodies play a limited role in cybersecurity provision, but the Security Service of Ukraine and the National Police of Ukraine are primarily responsible for counteracting cybercrime.

In Ukraine, law-enforcement bodies play a limited role in cybersecurity provision, primarily responsible for counteracting cybercrime such as offenses against computer data and systems, cyber fraud, and content-related offenses. There are difficulties in qualifying some of the crimes and jurisdictional conflicts between the Security Service and the Cyberpolice, which hinders effective cooperation. Both the Cyberpolice and the Security Service are bound by the Code of Criminal Procedure, but some mechanisms for investigating cybercrimes could be improved. Policy measures are also needed to establish an efficiently functioning system of cybersecurity. These measures should be implemented according to a set list of principles, which includes improving law-enforcement capabilities, and regulations for telecom providers and operators.

The article discusses principles related to free access to cyberspace and protection of rights, a systemic approach, and international cooperation in the context of Ukraine's external policy situation. It suggests that while enhancing cooperation with the EU and NATO, Ukraine should also consider its national interests and approach new international law obligations with caution. The measures discussed in the article include a variety of legal, organizational, economic, technical, monitoring, research, and public-private partnership initiatives. The article also mentions recent and perspective developments, including short-term goals outlined in the CNSD Decision on the Threats to Cybersecurity of the State and Immediate Measures of their Neutralization, and categories such as legislative activity, technological protection, financial sector security measures, and implementation of the National Program of Informatization.

The article discusses the steps taken by Ukraine to establish its system of cybersecurity, including the adoption of a series of normative documents such as the Cybersecurity Strategy and other acts. It mentions the recent achievement of limiting Russian software in Ukrainian information systems and networks, and the development of a Draft Law On the Fundamentals of the Provision of Cybersecurity of Ukraine that has passed its first reading in Parliament. The article concludes by stating that while Ukraine has taken many steps in establishing its system of cybersecurity, there is still more work to be done in areas such as key infrastructure protection, differentiation of responsibility for cybercrimes, and compliance with the Cybercrime Convention. The authors also suggest that the example of Ukraine can be used to make generalizations about the establishment of cybersecurity systems in other countries.

Provision of cybersecurity is a threat-based, risk-management function that requires a systemic approach, utilizing measures of various policies and capabilities of various actors, including the military, intelligence sector, law enforcement, and private sector. Criminal law plays an important role, but should not be equated with cybersecurity and placed more obligations on law enforcement than they can handle. The effectiveness of cybersecurity efforts can be hindered by poor distribution of tasks among actors.

The Petya ransomware is suspected to be a cyberattack in disguise. The attack was aimed at Ukraine and may have been planned for several months. Businesses and government institutions were affected, including the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Some experts warn that it could be a new form of cyber warfare and may have been carried out by a state-sponsored group.

WannaCry ransomware was used in widespread cyberattacks worldwide, including in Ukraine. The attacks were believed to be linked to Russian aggression and were considered the largest cyberattack in the country's history. Some sources suggested that the Petya 2.0 virus was used as a cover-up for the attack and that it was potentially an attack on the state. The cyberpolice of Ukraine also reported that Petya (Diskcoder.C) virus was the cover-up for the largest-scale cyberattack in the history of Ukraine.
