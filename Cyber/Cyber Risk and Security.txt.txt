This article discusses the importance of cyber risk in today's society, highlighting the increased dependence on IT systems and the weaknesses in defenses against cyber attacks. The COVID-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine have raised risks to levels not seen in the past 30 years. The article emphasizes the need for research and investment in building both cyber security and resilience in order to cope with this emerging risk.

Cyber risks are difficult to apprehend due to the rapidly evolving IT landscape and the emergence of new widely distributed applications. Resilience to cyber attacks includes fast detection and stopping of attacks, reducing their impact and fixing breaches, and ensuring access to cash through insurance covers. However, finding the right trade-offs between investing in security and resilience is a challenge for management. Additionally, cyber risks are not easily quantifiable, particularly because they affect intangibles such as data or reputation and raises fears of systemic risks. This makes it difficult for insurance companies to widely cover this risk.

The fear of systemic risks in cyber risk is a concern, and research is needed to study and explore the extent to which this fear is grounded. Research on systemic risk has been fostered by the financial crisis of 2008/2009 and research on cyber risk could inspire itself from the avenues proposed in the latter. Pluridisciplinary research is needed to fully grasp the various aspects of the risk and should not limit itself to exploring security solutions. Finding good data sources is important for progress in understanding cyber risk and the difficulty of accessing good data on cyber risk is a challenge.

This text discusses a Special Issue on the topic of cyber risk and its management. The authors note that the issue includes papers on various aspects of cyber security, including new ways of developing criminal investigations into cyber crimes, and that they aimed to gather contributions from researchers in disciplines other than statistics and actuarial mathematics to provide a multidisciplinary perspective on the topic. The issue also includes papers on insurance and cyber risk modeling, and the authors express appreciation for the researchers who have contributed to this unusual special volume.

This text discusses the research perspectives tackled in a Special Issue on the topic of cyber risk and its management. The authors mention that the issue includes papers addressing a wide range of topics related to cyber risk, such as new techniques of criminal investigations using the example of cyber crimes, the growing concerns about oligopolies in digital services and cyber security, and market concentration, the assessment of the risk of Intelligent Transportation Systems, the need of increasing the efficiency and safety of ITS through more communication between systems, and cyber security. They also mention papers that proposed a way to build an index of cyber risk, which could be used to offer good insurance covers.

Antonio et al. (2021) proposed a graph mining approach (GMA) to quantify cyber risk and determine insurance premiums, which leads to heterogeneous rating based on communication activity and results in lower rates than not using GMA. Other researchers have used network approaches to estimate cyber risk in absence of claims data, and Bentley et al. (2020) proposed a multivariate loss model based on six years of security engineer tickets to explore the effect of mitigation strategies on reducing the risk measure Value-at-Risk (VaR). Orlando proposed an approach called Cy-VaR to assess unexpected cyber loss at a specified confidence level over a given period of time, focusing on the vulnerability of systems, exposed assets, and the profile of the organization.

The author of the Special Issue discusses various approaches to understanding and combating cyber risk, highlighting the need for more data to challenge and test models. They also point out that researchers will need to work with companies to develop common databases that can be accessed for research. The article also mentions the need to further study systemic risks in the cyber space, as well as the links between IT systems and other types of catastrophic risks such as floods, earthquakes, windstorms and pandemics. Additionally, the article highlights the importance of criminal investigation in the fight against cyber attacks and the shift towards knowledge management of crime control.

This article discusses a program aimed at exploring methods for avoiding systemic failures and structuring hedging solutions in the electricity supply industry to ensure cash flow. The program is ambitious and the authors expect to have a lot of work in the coming years to increase the cyber resilience of society. No external funding was received for this research and the authors have no conflicts of interest.

This article references various studies on the use of counting processes and compartmental epidemiological models, extreme value theory, supply chain network game theory, cyber value at risk, and graph mining to investigate and model cybersecurity risks and investments in the field of cyber insurance. Specific topics include ratemaking, pricing, and risk levels in intelligent transportation systems. The studies cited were published in various journals between 2017 and 2022.
