This article discusses the system of cybersecurity in Ukraine, including its principles, actors, challenges, and accomplishments. It notes that cybersecurity is considered a priority area of national security in Ukraine, which has recently been the victim of multiple high-profile cyber attacks. The article describes the development of policy reforms aimed at improving the system of cybersecurity in Ukraine and highlights the achievements that have been made as well as the challenges that still need to be addressed. It also mentions that on October 5th 2017, the Ukrainian Parliament approved a draft law on the foundations of cybersecurity in Ukraine.

The article discusses the cybersecurity system in Ukraine and its legal framework. It mentions that the country faced a severe cyberattack, referred to as Petya, which caused damage to various organizations both in Ukraine and abroad. The article also notes that the policy directions and actors involved in cybersecurity in Ukraine remain the same, but that certain challenges and policy directions require specialized measures. The article also suggests that the system is still relevant and pressing.

The article discusses the importance of cybersecurity in national security, specifically in the context of a recent cyberattack (referred to as Petya) that caused damage to various organizations in Ukraine and abroad. The article notes that cyberthreats are relatively new phenomena that have a damage potential of incomparable scale. It also highlights some features of cyberthreats that make them a priority for developing threat management mechanisms, such as the ease of execution and difficulty in identifying and bringing perpetrators to justice. Additionally, the article notes that cyberthreats are constantly evolving and that the author has been monitoring the technology segments of global news and that days without a hack are rare exceptions.

The article discusses the chaotic spread of malware, specifically referencing the WannaCry example which affected various sectors and interests globally. It highlights the importance of united efforts to address cyberthreats as they have no regards for geographical or political borders. The focus of the article is on the Ukrainian approach to cybersecurity as a sphere of national security, analyzing its definition, key principles, actors involved, policy measures, achievements, and challenges. The article also notes the difficulty in clearly defining cybersecurity in Ukraine.

The article discusses the distinction between security and cybersecurity in Ukraine. Originally, cybersecurity was seen as a part of security which was an essential element of national security of the state. But lately, a certain distinction seems to occur in the regulatory level. The main provision of the Constitution of Ukraine regarding this area is Article 17 which states that protection of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, provision of its economic and information security are the most important functions of the state. However, there is no mention of cybersecurity per se. The Law On Information also does not provide a definition of information security and its connection to cybersecurity. A more useful source of normative provision is the Law On the Fundamentals of National Security of Ukraine which defines nine main areas of threats to national interests and national security.

Cybersecurity is a part of information security and includes the security of information and infrastructure in the digital environment. It aims to attain goals such as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, as well as monitoring of related processes. Threats to information security, as outlined by national legal researchers and the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, include limitations on freedom of speech, dissemination of harmful content, manipulation of public conscience, and computer crime and terrorism.

The article discusses the influence of citizens' behavior and conscience on informational resources and infrastructure, and the importance of complex approaches to establish information security and counter cybercrime as a part of state policy. The hierarchy of information security, cybersecurity, and cybercrime counteraction is mentioned. The regulatory level is said to be more complex, with differentiation between threats to information security and threats to cybersecurity and security of informational resources. The concept of development of security and defense sector of Ukraine and the doctrine of informational security of Ukraine also have similar differentiation, with an ideological angle.

The article discusses the regulation of information transmission through computer networks in a state of martial law in Ukraine. It states that the principles, priorities and directions of establishment of cybersecurity are provided by a separate normative act, the Strategy of Cybersecurity of Ukraine. This strategy regulates several areas of cybersecurity, including the protection of state information resources and key infrastructure, and counteracting cybercrime. The article also mentions that the development and security of cyberspace, establishment of electronic governance, security and sustainable functioning of electronic communication and state electronic informational resources are elements of the state policy in the area of development of informational space and development of the informational society in Ukraine. It also notes that there is confusion between the concepts of information security and cybersecurity in the regulatory acts.

The article discusses the correlation between information security and cybersecurity in Ukraine, noting that there is confusion between the concepts in regulatory acts. It states that a cyberterrorist who hacks a power plant does not directly harm information security, but hacking a government website affects both spheres. The article also notes that cybersecurity is not defined on a legislative level, and advocates for more research and a consistent legislative framework to be established. The main features of cybersecurity in Ukraine, as understood by the state, include the importance of protecting interests in cyberspace and the use of legal, organizational, and informational measures to achieve this.

Cybersecurity is defined as the protection of vital interests in cyberspace, and is considered a key area of national security in Ukraine. It is viewed as a threat-based, risk-management function and requires a coordinated approach involving various actors and sectoral policies.

Cybersecurity is achieved through a combination of legal, organizational, and informational measures. The Strategy of National Security of Ukraine regulates the parties involved and the perspective directions of development. Threats to cybersecurity include the Petya malware, which affected various organizations in Ukraine in 2017, and attacks on the energy sector, with one of the first successful attacks being registered in December 2015. These threats are viewed as a prime function to corrupt data, masked as ransomeware.

Cyberattacks targeted energy systems in Ukraine, shutting down 30 substations and leaving 230,000 people without electricity for up to 6 hours. The attack used a trojan called Black energy delivered via forged emails, followed by control of automated systems to shut down substations, further disabling IT infrastructure and deleting information. The attackers also carried out DDoS attacks against call centers. A similar, smaller-scale attack was carried out in 2016. In 2014, an automated election system was compromised during presidential elections, with a fabricated image being uploaded to servers and used by Russian media to support a certain candidate.

In 2016, several cyberattacks targeted state financial organizations in Ukraine, causing delays in budget payments and utilizing similar software as in previous attacks on the energy sector. Other cybersecurity threats included the hacking of Regional State Administrations and the discovery of malware in an electronic flight control system. The complexity of these attacks suggests involvement of a stronger power.

The Euromaidan events of 2013-2014 in Ukraine were followed by various forms of malicious cyberactivity, including blocking of mobile communications, hacking of electronic media websites and personal emails/social accounts of politicians, DDoS attacks on government bodies, and the use of a worm (with a rootkit) called snake, ouraboros or turla to infect information systems of state bodies, media, financial entities, and large industry companies. The main goal was theft of confidential information and/or prolonged monitoring. This suggests the need to establish a proper relationship between cybersecurity and information security on both theoretical and legislative levels. A similar event occurred in 2012 with the Ex.ua hacktivism incident, where a file-sharing service was blocked by Ukrainian law-enforcement bodies, leading to DDoS attacks on government websites.

A hacktivist cyberattack in Ukraine occurred in 2012 where government websites were targeted with DDoS attacks by citizens coordinated through social networks and using easy-to-use services like the Low Orbit Ion Cannon. The Security Service of Ukraine detected a number of these hacks and initiated 25 criminal proceedings, however no direct financial harm was done to state bodies and no real conclusions about the state of Ukrainian cybersecurity were made. In addition to these high-profile incidents, day-to-day cybercrime such as cyber fraud, content-related offences, and illegal use and sale of software also occur in Ukraine. Non-intentional malfunctions in automated systems are also a potential threat in cybersecurity, but there is limited data on actualizations of these threats in Ukraine.

Threats can come in different forms, from different actors with various motives, and can target various objects with varying consequences. Cybercrime is one possible classification for these incidents, but it may not be practical for dealing with different types of threats. Law enforcement alone may not be sufficient for dealing with foreign intelligence service cyberattacks on key infrastructure, while specialized counterintelligence or military actors may not be necessary for dealing with a hack into a social network account. The appropriate response to a threat should be assessed based on its qualities and a combination of measures and capabilities from various structures should be used for management.

The creation of response mechanisms for different types of cyber threats requires a classification of threats, which is currently lacking in Ukraine. The Strategy of National Security lists two main threats to cybersecurity, but they can be argued as factors that allow for actualization of threats, rather than threats themselves. The document is inconsistent and concepts are undefined, it speaks of cyber warfare, intelligence, and subversive activity of foreign special agencies and cyber attacks on informational resources of financial institutions, transport, energy, and public authorities.

The violation of automatized processes in key infrastructure can be considered cyberterrorism. Other types of cyberattacks include politically motivated acts against websites that alter information or block access. The Strategy notes that the current state of technology allows for new means of traditional crimes and the emergence of new crimes, such as illegal collection, storage, use, and deletion of personal data, illegal financial operations, theft and fraud over the Internet. Categorization of cyberthreats to the Ukrainian state and society include classical cybercrime and cybercrimes specific to geopolitical conflict, such as hacktivism, cyberespionage, and cyber-sabotage. The researcher notes that it is hard to separate the crimes due to the use of similar methods and omits the category of unintentional incidents. The Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union also highlights that threats can have different origins including criminal, politically motivated, terrorist or state-sponsored attacks as well as natural disasters and unintentional mistakes.

The concept of cybersecurity incidents, whether intentional or accidental, is used in the EU Strategy as a starting point for classifying cyberthreats. The EU Strategy does not establish a complete classification, but some approaches can be inferred from its provisions, such as threats to cyber resilience, cybercrimes, and threats to cyber defense. The Ukrainian Draft Law also uses this concept and focuses on it later in the article. The EU Strategy mentions different actors and features of incidents to respond to different types of incidents, such as serious impact on business continuity, relation to a crime, espionage, state-sponsored attack, national security implications, and compromise of personal data. Based on the EU Strategy's approaches, the threats to the cybersecurity of Ukraine may be divided into three broad categories: threats aimed at cyber defense actions, generic cybercrimes and threats to cyber resilience.

The main actors involved in providing national security in the area of cybersecurity in Ukraine include the Council of National Security and Defense, which coordinates and controls the activity of the subjects of the Sector of Security and Defense, the National Coordination Center of Cybersecurity, the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff, intelligence bodies and the SSU, national police, technical protection regulators, private sector companies, research and educational facilities, and other organizations, associations, and citizens. Tasks include analysis of the state of cybersecurity and various parameters.

The main actors involved in providing national security in the area of cybersecurity in Ukraine include the Council of National Security and Defense, which coordinates and controls the activity of the subjects of the Sector of Security and Defense, the National Coordination Center of Cybersecurity, the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff, intelligence bodies and the SSU, national police, technical protection regulators, private sector companies, research and educational facilities, and other organizations, associations, and citizens. Tasks include analysis of the state of cybersecurity and various parameters such as prognostication and detection of cyberthreats, development, implementation and supervision of cybersecurity measures propositions, and measures of information exchange between actors and measures of international cooperation. The military structures of this pillar are represented by the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the Armed Forces, whose main tasks include repelling military aggression in cyberspace, military cooperation with NATO in the areas of cybersecurity and mutual protection from cyberthreats, and cyberprotection of informational infrastructure of the armed forces.

The Minister of Defense of Ukraine has announced the development of a new unit for cybersecurity with assistance from NATO, with the intelligence bodies and Security Service of Ukraine tasked with carrying out intelligence activity and investigating incidents related to national security and cybercrime. The National Police of Ukraine also enforces protection of rights and liberties in relation to cybersecurity.

The group of Technical Protection Regulators is represented by the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection, tasked with forming and implementing state policy on cyberprotection and state control of cyberprotection of state information resources and key informational infrastructure. The structure of the service includes a specialized division, CERT-UA, which is responsible for counteracting cyberthreats to the state with technical means. The National Bank of Ukraine is also tasked with establishing requirements for cyberprotection of critical information infrastructure in the banking sector. The private sector is not directly instructed, but it is necessary to create conditions for their participation in areas such as electronic commerce and banking.

The article discusses the provision of cybersecurity in Ukraine, specifically the involvement of non-state bodies such as organizations and educational facilities in the development and implementation of cybersecurity measures. However, it notes that the area of public-private partnership is still in an early stage of development and that there is a lack of specialized research institutions in the cybersecurity area. The article also mentions that there are limitations to the role of law enforcement in providing cybersecurity and that it is one of four pillars on which the system stands. The Security Service of Ukraine has a twofold capacity of counterintelligence and investigative, and its main legal base of functioning is the Law On the Security Service of Ukraine.

The article discusses the role of law enforcement in providing cybersecurity in Ukraine. The Security Service of Ukraine has a twofold capacity of counterintelligence and investigative, with its main legal base of functioning being the Law On the Security Service of Ukraine. The main counterintelligence department in the area of cybersecurity is the Unit of Counterintelligence Protection of the Interests of the State in the Sphere of Information Security. However, the focus is on the investigative activity with regard to cybercrime and depending on the type of crime, this task can fall under different units of the Service. The National Police deals with the majority of cybercrimes and its main legal base of functioning is the respective provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Law On National Police. The police is going through a series of structural reforms, including the re-attestation of its staff and more reforms are planned in the nearest future. The current specialized division operating in the area of cybercrime counteraction is the Department of Cyberpolice.

The Cyberpolice Department in Ukraine has various functions, including solving cybercrimes, carrying out investigative actions, establishing a 24/7 contact network for crime reporting, analyzing factors that lead to cybercrime, developing legislative measures, and educating the public on cybersecurity. They also play a role in professional development for the National Police, and engage in community outreach and education. The systemic approach to cybersecurity provision can be seen within the diversity of activities of the department, and the tasks include crime prevention.

The nature of crime-preventive functions of law-enforcement bodies in relation to cybercrime is debatable. Some researchers argue that prevention consists of various measures, including economic, ideological, legal, educational, technical, and cryptographic, and the impact that the actual enforcement of the law has on crime prevention seems to be limited in this area of illegal activity. However, new trends in criminal legislation allow for an increasing scope of the preventive functions of criminal law. The classification of cybercrimes is widely accepted as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, and responsibility for this category is mainly prescribed by a separate Chapter XVI of the Special Part of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.

The System of Cybersecurity in Ukraine consists of a number of criminal code provisions related to computer and telecommunications networks, including unsanctioned interference, the creation or distribution of malicious software, and unauthorized access to information. Penalties for these crimes can include fines, imprisonment, and prohibitions on certain activities or positions. There have been many high-profile cases, such as the Petya malware infection, as well as lower-profile cases. As of July 2017, 597 criminal proceedings had been initiated for crimes related to these provisions.

A person was found guilty in the online sale of software designed to carry out DDoS attacks and for demonstrating the operability of said software by carrying out several DDoS attacks. The criminal code also establishes responsibility for other offences related to accumulation and disclosure of specific types of restricted information, which can be carried out through the use of computers and/or networks. Examples include espionage, treason, and illegal gathering or utilization of commercial or banking secrets. In practice, such acts are often qualified as multiple offences. The Convention establishes obligations to criminalize only two computer-related crimes: computer-related forgery and computer-related fraud.

Computer-related crimes are conducted through manipulation of computer data or interference with computer systems and can include a wide range of offenses. Cyber fraud is specifically defined in the Criminal Code of Ukraine as fraud committed through illegal electronic-computational devices. Other examples of cyber crimes include cyber forgery, online scams, and illegal activities such as gambling and drug sales conducted through the internet. Some high-profile incidents have also been connected to the energy sector.

Cybercrimes can share characteristics with acts of terrorism or attacks on objects that pose a danger to the environment. However, the criminal code does not have specific clauses for these crimes committed through the use of computers and networks. Content-related offenses include child pornography and violations of copyright and related rights, which can be committed through the use of computers and networks. Examples include a case of copyright infringement and distribution of pirated video content, as well as a case of child pornography distribution by a schoolteacher.

The 2003 Additional Protocol 27 to the Convention on Cybercrime introduced the category of offences related to acts of racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems, such as dissemination of racist and xenophobic material, threats, and insults through computer systems. Responsibility for these crimes is established in the Criminal Code of Ukraine, but there are no specific cyber clauses present in the articles. The wording allows for acts committed through computers/networks to be qualified as such either independently or as multiple offences. Jurisdiction for investigating these crimes falls under the National Police, but the Security Service also has a role in investigating cybercrimes.

The criminalization of acts of racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems was introduced in Strasbourg on January 28th, 2003. However, the qualification of these relatively new categories of crimes leads to potential jurisdictional conflicts, which may reduce the effectiveness of cybersecurity in this area. In terms of investigative powers, the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for two categories of investigative activity: investigative actions and covert investigative actions. Investigative actions are carried out in the presence of the person whose rights are being infringed, while covert investigative actions are more directly linked to counteracting crimes related to cybercrime. Law enforcement officers can be held accountable if their actions exceed legal requirements and cause substantial harm.

Covert investigative actions, such as interference in private communication and interception of information from telecom networks, are allowed to be carried out in Ukraine under certain circumstances, with the approval of an investigating judge. Telecom operators are required to facilitate these actions and keep them confidential. However, the ultimate responsibility for cyber crimes is not clearly defined and there is competition between different government agencies.

The article discusses potential improvements in law enforcement's ability to address cybercrime in Ukraine. It highlights issues of jurisdictional overlap and suggests changes to procedural and substantial law to clarify the features of cybercrimes and differentiate criminal responsibility for different types of cybercrimes. It also notes underdeveloped investigative powers and suggests potential developments such as improved methods for acquiring electronic evidence, real-time procedural actions, and increased obligation of telecom providers to record and store data. The article suggests Ukraine should focus on developing these areas to improve its ability to tackle cybercrime.

The article discusses the importance of improving the capabilities of law enforcement bodies in dealing with cybercrimes through cooperation, response speed, and training in handling electronic evidence. It also highlights the need for drafting and implementing policy measures in cybersecurity, and outlines the guiding principles that should be upheld in doing so, such as protecting rights and liberties, a systemic approach, and international cooperation.

The article discusses the need for cooperation and policy measures in preventing cybercrimes and deterring illegal and military use of cyberspace, while also upholding the national interests of Ukraine. It also notes that national security threats, including those to cybersecurity, are connected to the ongoing conflict with the Russian Federation, and highlights the importance of cooperation with the European Union, NATO, and the international community in dealing with these threats. The article also mentions that the Cybersecurity Strategy is based on the principles of the Budapest Cybercrime Convention.

The System of Cybersecurity in Ukraine involves cooperation with NATO and EU in order to combat cyberthreats. This cooperation is beneficial for both Ukraine and the EU, as Ukraine's information infrastructure can be used as a transit base for attacks against third states including EU members. Without a common cybersecurity policy, these factors will still pose threats to EU states. Ukraine aims to establish itself as a strong independent state and a contributing, democratic member of the international community in the cyberspace.

Ukraine should be cautious when engaging in international cooperation and taking on international law obligations. It should carefully evaluate which deals align with its national interests, take initiative in drafting proposals, and assume more responsibility in shaping its present and future. The measures for Ukraine's system of cybersecurity, as outlined in the Strategy, include development of a safe, stable and resilient cyberspace. This includes drafting and implementing policies, harmonizing documents, and attaining compliance with international, EU, and NATO standards.

The article discusses various measures for cyberprotection in Ukraine, including participation in international cooperation initiatives, development of electronic communication infrastructure and technologies for cyberprotection, formation of a competitive environment for electronic communication and cybersecurity services, monitoring and reactive measures for state control of information protection, and social outreach efforts to raise digital awareness and educate citizens on cyberthreats and cyberprotection. The measures also involve the involvement of expert potential from scientific facilities and professional associations. The category also includes technical measures for protecting state information resources and the information infrastructure that processes restricted information, such as creating and maintaining a national telecom network for protected electronic communications of the state.

The article discusses measures for cyberprotection of key infrastructure in Ukraine which include two groups. The first group focuses on the development of a normative framework that regulates the main principles of protection, criteria of key infrastructure, forming and establishing a state registry of key infrastructure objects, drafting specific regulations for the cyberprotection of said objects, and establishing qualification requirements and mandatory periodical certifications for staff members that service them. The second group focuses on enhancing private-public cooperation in this area, such as organizing cooperation, developing state-private partnership in preventing cyberthreats, reacting to cyberattacks and incidents, neutralizing their consequences, and developing a mechanism of information exchange on cyberthreats towards key infrastructure. It also includes measures related to the development of requirements for secure internet usage and provision of electronic services by state bodies, increasing the awareness of employees of state bodies involved in information and cybersecurity, and carrying out respective trainings.

Measures are being carried out by the state, private sector, and citizens to improve cybersecurity, including the creation and assurance of functioning of cyberprotection units in various objects. These measures mainly involve military and intelligence bodies, as well as the National Police and the Security Service, and include enhancing the capacity to manage high-profile threats, creating a single Armed Forces cybersecurity unit, and enforcing cybersecurity in objects of key infrastructure. Additionally, measures are being taken to limit the role of organizations under Russian Federation influence in information security and cybersecurity, as well as changes in criminal law related to cybercrimes. Scientific and educational measures are also being implemented, such as development and coordination of research in the area of cybersecurity and cyberprotection for national security and defense, and developing a system of professional training for staff in the sector.

Fighting cybercrime is seen as one of the categories of cybersecurity policies of a state and is limited in the system of cybersecurity. Measures for fighting cybercrime include organizational changes such as establishing a protocol of joint action for law enforcement bodies and creating a contact center for reporting cybercrime, as well as normative changes such as improving investigative powers and regulating the use of electronic evidence. Additionally, measures include developing procedures for blocking identified information resources and training judges and law enforcement personnel to work with electronic evidence. The challenges in fighting cybercrime include improving the speed of response from law enforcement bodies and elevating the qualification level of law enforcement operatives.

The article discusses the priority cybersecurity measures that need to be adopted by Ukraine in the near future. It mentions a system of measures found in the CNSD Decision on the Treats to Cybersecurity of the State and Immediate Measures of their Neutralization. The article also mentions that steps have been made in this direction, such as the creation of an application form for reporting cybercrime on the website of the Department of Cyberpolice. However, it also notes that the existence of duplicate contact centers raises concerns about the effectiveness of the system and institutional competition. The article also mentions a new decision that was adopted after the submission of the article for review, which focuses on strengthening the protection of systems and networks of state bodies and state-owned enterprises as well as key financial institutions.

The article discusses the System of Cybersecurity in Ukraine and the measures set forth in the CNSD Decision on the Treats to Cybersecurity of the State and Immediate Measures of their Neutralization. It mentions that the decision provides for the activation of international cooperation, the drafting and submission of a law on differentiation of responsibility and investigative jurisdiction in regards to cybercrimes, and the implementation of a list of measures with various timeframes for their enactment. The article notes that the authorities have been failing to meet many of the measures set forth in the decision, but the aim of the publication is not to evaluate the implementation of the policies in detail, but to identify the next steps. The measures prescribed by the decision are divided into several categories, including legislative (regulatory) activity, technical measures, and organizational measures. The article also notes that some parts of the decision, specifically para.3 and para.4, are secret and not available to the public, which may be inconsistent with the principle of democratic civil control over cybersecurity.

The article discusses measures to improve cybersecurity for key infrastructure in Ukraine, including setting conditions for cybersecurity, outlining rights and obligations of parties involved, establishing protocols for joint action in cases of cyberattacks and incidents, limiting the use of software and devices from aggressor-states, and forming a list of information-telecom systems for key infrastructure. Additionally, there are measures to increase responsibility for violations in cybersecurity, and measures to comply with the Budapest Cybercrime Convention, which Ukraine signed in 2001 and ratified in 2005, but has not fully implemented.

The article discusses measures to improve cybersecurity in Ukraine, including measures to enhance the legal and technical aspects of national cybersecurity, such as creating protected data centers and a national telecom network, as well as stimulating the development of Ukrainian software. Additionally, there are measures aimed at enhancing security in the banking and financial sectors, such as establishing a legal mechanism to block the functioning of electronic payment systems from aggressor-states, and working with various government agencies to draft and implement these measures.

The National Program of Informatization is a program in Ukraine aimed at the development of a modern informational infrastructure, including the creation, development, and integration of information systems and networks, as well as the acquisition of means of informatization to support the functioning of state bodies and other organizations. The program was originally adopted in 1998 and has undergone several changes, but does not seem to be correspondent to recent initiatives in national security or cybersecurity. The program is proposing new measures for 2018-2020, including the inclusion of new tasks and a concrete roadmap of measures into the draft law on the State budget and the establishment of a General state charterer to address current cybersecurity threats.

Ukraine has been making significant progress in the formation of its system of cybersecurity, but there is still much work to be done. This is not unique to Ukraine as many world powers are also in the early stages of forming their systems of cybersecurity. Despite this, Ukraine has achieved a lot in the area of cybersecurity, including the adoption of a series of normative documents that establish the basic framework of the system, such as the Strategy of National Security, Cybersecurity Strategy, and the Concept of Development of the Sector of Security and Defense. Recently, Ukraine has also implemented special sanctions directed at physical and legal persons related to the Russian Federation according to a series of CNDS Decisions. These sanctions serve both as an economic retaliation in response to the conflict and as a way to counter cybersecurity threats.

The article discusses restrictions placed on the use of Russian software in Ukrainian information systems and networks, including antivirus software companies Dr.Web and Kaspersky Lab, as well as popular social networks VKontakte and Odnoklassniki, Mail.ru and Yandex services, in order to align with the developmental directions of the Strategy of Cybersecurity and a Decision on the Law. The restrictions have a direct positive impact on cybersecurity, but also have a controversial impact on the population as some people find ways to access the blocked services. The article also mentions a draft law on the topic.

The article discusses the draft law "Fundamentals of the Provision of Cybersecurity of Ukraine" which was adopted after first reading in September 2016 and was prepared for a second reading. However, after a second reading in May 2017, the parliament decided to return the draft to the committee for further modifications before bringing it to another reading in the future. The normative framework of cybersecurity in Ukraine is currently based on acts of the regulatory level, which the draft law aims to address as a possible solution. The draft law establishes a terminological base on the legislative level and it's main achievement is providing for a vast terminological base on the legislative level, but it does not regulate all the cybersecurity questions in detail.

In 2014, Ukraine reported 18 million cyber incidents and by 2017, Vkontakte in Ukraine set a new record. The article discusses the need for a clear and consistent legal framework for cybersecurity in Ukraine, as the current law operates with concepts that are not well defined or have inconsistent definitions. The Draft Law aims to define key terminology and establish the fundamentals of the cybersecurity system in Ukraine, as well as its principles and actors. It also addresses international cooperation in the form of cooperation with foreign states and their law enforcement agencies.

The Draft Law on cybersecurity in Ukraine aims to establish a clear and consistent legal framework for cybersecurity in the country. It defines key terminology and establishes the principles and actors involved in cybersecurity. The Draft also addresses international cooperation in the form of cooperation with foreign states and their law enforcement agencies, as well as international organizations. It also establishes criteria for objects of key infrastructure, and includes provisions for state-private cooperation in the area of cybersecurity, including the creation of a system of rapid detection and prevention of cyber threats and the involvement of experts and professional associations in cybersecurity projects. The Draft also includes a mechanism of public control of the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures. The challenges of cybersecurity regulation in Ukraine begin with its normative definition, which is defined as the protection of vital interests of persons, citizens, society and state.

Cybersecurity and information security are two spheres of national security in Ukraine that possess different qualities and cannot be subordinate or alternative to each other. There is a need for further research and a consistent legislative framework to establish the borders of these spheres. The Ukrainian state approach to cybersecurity is threat-based and employs a risk-management function, and a systemic approach is needed for its provision. Ukraine has faced multiple threats in recent years, including the spread of malware such as Petya and WannaCry.

Threats to cybersecurity in Ukraine can be of different nature and come from various actors with different motives. They can target different objects and result in various consequences. A systemic approach to provision of cybersecurity is needed to assess and manage these threats. The article proposes a classification of threats into three categories: those aimed at cyber defense, generic cybercrimes, and threats to cyber resilience. Normative acts lack a coherent classification of threats and the attempts of researchers are debatable. The article presents an attempt to classify threats to the cybersecurity of Ukraine, drawing inspiration from the EU Cybersecurity Strategy.

The system of actors tasked with providing cybersecurity in Ukraine can be divided into four basic pillars: defense and intelligence structures, law enforcement bodies, technical protection regulators, the private sector and a coordinator, the National Coordination Center of Cybersecurity of the CNSD. The private sector plays a limited role in this system as the legal framework for public-private partnership is not fully developed and there are not many specialized research institutions that contribute to cybersecurity. Law enforcement bodies play a limited but important role in counteracting cybercrime. The main actors in this area are the Security Service of Ukraine and the National Police of Ukraine's Department of Cyberpolice.

The law enforcement bodies in Ukraine play a limited but important role in counteracting cybercrime. The main actors in this area are the Security Service of Ukraine and the National Police of Ukraine's Department of Cyberpolice. They are tasked with investigating cybercrimes such as offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems, computer-related offences, content-related offences, acts of racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems. However, there are difficulties in the qualification of some of these acts, which creates a basis for jurisdictional conflicts between the Security Service and the Cyberpolice, hindering effective cooperation. The policy measures for cyber security require drafting and implementing a variety of sectoral policy measures in accordance with a set list of principles.

The article discusses principles related to free access to cyberspace and protection of rights, as well as principles related to a systemic approach and international cooperation. It highlights the importance of balancing Ukraine's cooperation with the EU and NATO with national interests, and notes that various measures, including legal, organizational, economic, technical, and public-private partnership initiatives, are being implemented to address cybersecurity challenges. The article also mentions recent and future developments in Ukraine's cybersecurity efforts, including legislative activity, technological protection, financial sector security measures, and the implementation of a national program of informatization.

The article discusses the progress made in establishing a system of cybersecurity in Ukraine. It mentions the adoption of a number of normative documents that establish the framework for the system, including the Cybersecurity Strategy and other acts. A recent achievement is the limitation of Russian software in Ukrainian information systems and networks, although it presents some challenges. The article also highlights the development of a draft law on the fundamentals of cybersecurity in Ukraine that has passed its first reading in parliament and is expected to be adopted in the near future, which aims to solve several problems and inconsistencies. The authors also note that while significant steps have been taken to establish a cybersecurity system in Ukraine, there is still much work to be done, including establishment of detailed regulation of key infrastructure protection, differentiation of responsibility for cybercrimes, attaining further compliance with the Cybercrime Convention, as well as drafting and implementing measures of organizational, economical, technical, etc. nature.

Provision of cybersecurity is a threat-based, risk-management function that requires a systemic approach and the participation of various actors including military, intelligence, law-enforcement, and private sector. It should not be equated with cybercrime counteraction and placing excessive obligations on criminal law or law-enforcement bodies. A tool-kit of measures and policies is necessary for negation of cyber threats.

The Petya ransomware attack in July 2017 is believed to have been a cyberattack in disguise. The attack targeted Ukraine and caused widespread disruption to businesses and government systems. Some sources suggest that the attack was planned for several months and was orchestrated by a state-sponsored group. Other sources warn that the attack was unprecedented in scale and that businesses and organizations should take steps to protect themselves from similar threats.

In 2017, a widespread ransomware attack known as WannaCry affected many countries and organizations around the world, including British Airways.
