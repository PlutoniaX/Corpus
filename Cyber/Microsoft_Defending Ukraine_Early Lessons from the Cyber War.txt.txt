The article discusses the role of technology in the war in Ukraine, specifically mentioning the use of a cyberweapon called Foxblade that was launched against computers in Ukraine before the traditional military invasion on February 24, 2022. The author reflects on the importance of understanding the technology used in the war and its impact on the people involved.

The article discusses the impact of technology on the ongoing war in a specific country and how it reflects a trend seen in other major conflicts in the past two centuries. The war in this country involves the use of cyber strategies by one of the parties involved, including destructive cyberattacks, network penetration and espionage, and cyber influence operations. The article provides an analysis of these strategies and suggests ideas for countering them. It also notes that the cyber aspect of the war extends beyond the country and highlights the unique nature of cyberspace and the need for a new form of collective defense involving countries, companies, and NGOs. The article also mentions that the world can now start to assess the early strengths and weaknesses of offensive and defensive cyber operations and where collective defenses are needed.

The article discusses the importance of assessing the impact of cyberattacks in a specific ongoing war, including the strengths and weaknesses of defensive efforts and technological innovations taking place. It notes that it's important to base these assessments on accurate data and not be misled by an external perception that the war has not been as destructive as feared. The article offers five conclusions from the first four months of the war: 1) Defense against a military invasion now requires for most countries the ability to disperse and distribute digital operations and data assets across borders and into other countries. 2) Recent advances in cyber threat intelligence and end-point protection have helped Ukraine withstand a high percentage of destructive cyberattacks from Russia. 3) The tech sector's efforts have been vital but it's also important to consider the longer-lasting lessons that come from these efforts. 4) The Russian military has launched multiple waves of destructive cyberattacks against 48 distinct Ukrainian agencies and enterprises, which sought to penetrate networks and cause disruption. 5) The article also mention that to effectively defend against cyberattacks in the future, the tech sector and governments must work together to disburse and distribute digital operations and data assets across borders and into other countries.

Russian cyber tactics in the war have involved compromising hundreds of computers and spreading malware designed to destroy software and data on thousands of others. The tactics used in the 2022 attack on Ukraine differ from those used in the 2017 NotPetya attack, with the current attacks being more sophisticated and widespread. Cyber defenses, including the use of artificial intelligence and internet-connected endpoint protection, have proven stronger than offensive capabilities so far. However, continued vigilance and innovation will likely be needed to sustain this defensive advantage. Additionally, Russian intelligence agencies have stepped up network penetration and espionage activities targeting allied governments outside of Ukraine.

Microsoft has detected Russian network intrusion efforts on 128 organizations in 42 countries outside of Ukraine. The United States is the main target, but Poland, the Baltic countries, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Turkey have also been prioritized, particularly in government and NATO-related entities. The Russian targeting has also included think tanks, humanitarian organizations, IT companies and critical infrastructure suppliers. Since the start of the war, the Russian targeting has been successful 29% of the time, with 25% of successful intrusions resulting in confirmed data exfiltration. The company is most concerned about government computers that are running on premises, rather than in the cloud. The Russian intelligence agencies have sophisticated capabilities to implant code and operate as an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) that can obtain and exfiltrate sensitive information from a network on an ongoing basis. There have been advances in defensive protection since the SolarWinds incident 18 months ago, but the implementation of these advances remains more uneven in European governments than in the United States.

Russian agencies are conducting global cyber influence operations to support their war efforts by combining tactics developed by the KGB with new digital technologies. These operations are aimed at sustaining support for the war effort among the Russian population, undermining confidence in Ukraine's ability to withstand attacks, undermining Western unity and deflecting criticism of Russian military war crimes, and targeting populations in nonaligned countries. They use tactics such as Advance Persistent Manipulator (APM) teams and pre-positioning false narratives on social media and digital platforms.

Microsoft is using AI, analytics tools, broader data sets, and a growing staff of experts to track and forecast Russian cyber influence operations. These operations use technology tools to exploit social media services and spread false narratives, such as those around biolabs in Ukraine and military attacks against Ukrainian civilian targets. They also spread false COVID-19 narratives in multiple Western countries to discourage vaccine adoption and inflame public opposition to COVID-19 policies. Microsoft estimates that these operations successfully increased the spread of Russian propaganda by 216% in Ukraine and 82% in the United States. They plan to expand their work in this field through internal growth and the acquisition of a leading cyber threat analysis and research company. They are concerned that many current Russian cyber influence operations go undetected for months, impacting a wide range of institutions in both the public and private sectors.

The article discusses the increasing threat of foreign cyber influence attacks and the need to strengthen Western defenses against them. It suggests that the lessons learned from the war in Ukraine call for a coordinated and comprehensive strategy to address the full range of cyber destructive, espionage, and influence operations. The article proposes four defensive tenets to counter these threats, which include recognizing that Russian cyber threats are advanced by a common set of actors and relying on similar tactics, increased collaboration between public and private sectors, multilateral collaboration among governments, and upholding free expression while addressing cyber threats. Additionally, it suggests four strategic pillars to increase collective capabilities in detecting, defending, disrupting, and deterring foreign cyber threats.

The article discusses the need for a comprehensive approach with new capabilities and defenses to combat Russian cyber influence operations, drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine. It highlights the changes the 21st century has brought to governments, as they now rely on digital communications and data, and the importance of disbursing these digital operations into the public cloud and outside the country to protect against destructive cyberattacks and cyber-based espionage, including ransomware attacks. The article also mentions that the company is committed to supporting these efforts, including through ongoing and new investments in technology, data, and partnerships that will support governments, companies, NGOs, and universities.

Before Russian troops invaded Ukraine, the country's government quickly moved critical data to the public cloud with the help of tech companies, including Microsoft, which provided $107 million of technology services at no charge. This allowed the government to evacuate data outside the country and into data centers across Europe, protecting it from potential missile and cyber attacks by the Russian military. This highlights the importance of protecting public-sector data in times of war, as opposed to peace, and the benefits of using the public cloud for data protection.

The war in Ukraine illustrates the importance of a country's ability to quickly move data outside its borders while still being able to rely on it for digital operations. The defense needs during a war are different than during peace time. The article compares the current cyberattacks and defensive cybersecurity operations in Ukraine to the historical Battle of Britain, where the use of radar was crucial in detecting and defending against bombers. The offensive cyberattacks have been successful in disabling targets, but have not yet achieved the broader strategic goals of the attackers.

Russian government entities have been responsible for cyberattacks on Ukraine's defenses, using tactics such as targeted phishing, planting wiper malware, and replicating or spreading malware to other computers across a network domain. These attacks have been sophisticated, persistent and have been observed across the cyber activities of Russia's intelligence community and military. The Russian cyberattacks have been aimed at data theft, destruction of computer hard disks, and influence operations. Some examples of the malware used are Foxblade, CaddyWiper, Industroer2 DEV-0586, WhisperGate wiper, and others.

A group associated with Russian military intelligence has launched multiple cyberattacks using various forms of malware against Ukrainian agencies and enterprises. The group, known as Iridium or Sandworm, was also responsible for the NotPetya attack in 2017. The attacks have sought to penetrate networks by initially compromising a large number of computers, and then spreading malware to thousands of others. The Russian military has also adapted its cyberattacks to its changing war needs and has used them in conjunction with conventional weapons to disable computer networks before targeting them with ground troops or aerial or missile attacks.

Russian forces targeted a Ukrainian government agency with a destructive cyberattack using malware families such as WhisperGate, FoxBlade, and DesertBlade, which overwrite data and render machines unbootable. They also used conventional weapons against government buildings. The attacks were strategic and deliberate, confined to specific network domains within Ukraine and coordinated with missile attacks targeting the country's transportation systems.

Russian military group Iridium targeted railway substations in Ukraine with missiles and digital attacks, but the impact of the cyberattacks has been limited due to improved cybersecurity defenses and threat intelligence. The private sector, such as Microsoft's MSTIC, now has access to more data to detect and respond to anomalies, and AI-based cybersecurity protection is being implemented to augment this protection further. This type of detection capability is particularly helpful for organizations using cloud services.

Microsoft has implemented AI-based detection and internet-connected end-point protection to block malware and distribute protective software signatures to devices. This has been done through partnerships with the Ukrainian government and the use of technology from RiskIQ to identify and map organizational attack surfaces. These measures have played a critical role in halting the spread of destructive malware in Ukraine. Microsoft has also shared this information with the Ukrainian government free of charge to strengthen cyber defenses.

The Ukrainian government authorized Microsoft to remotely turn on the controlled folder access feature across devices throughout the country due to difficulties in accessing devices during wartime conditions. This highlights the role of private sector companies in protecting a country during war, the responsibility of tech companies to invest in ongoing innovation to exceed offensive cyber-attack tactics, and the importance of cybersecurity protection for all organizations and individuals worldwide, as captured by CISA's "Shields Up" phrase.

A coalition of countries has come together to defend Ukraine from Russian cyber attacks and espionage activities, with a focus on obtaining information from inside governments playing critical roles in the West's response to the war. The increase in activity appears to be targeting government agencies, NGOs, IT companies, and energy and other companies involved in critical defense or economic sectors. The majority of this activity has been directed at NATO members, with 63 percent of the observed activity involving these countries.

The Russian government has increased its cyber espionage activities targeting governments outside of Ukraine, with a focus on obtaining information from inside governments playing critical roles in the West's response to the war. The majority of this activity has been directed at NATO members, with the United States and countries closest to Ukraine being the most targeted. This includes Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. MSTIC's observations have found that Russian actors have been successful in 29 percent of the attacks and in a quarter of these successful intrusions, data exfiltration was identified. Microsoft notifies customers when it detects a nation-state attack against them, regardless of whether the attack was successful.

The article discusses the extent of Russian cyber espionage and their success rate in exfiltrating sensitive information from local servers. It also highlights the advancements in defensive protection, particularly in cloud services and cloud security technology, but notes that implementation of these advances is uneven, especially among European governments, leaving significant collective defensive weaknesses. Additionally, the article discusses the use of cyber influence operations by Russian agencies in support of their war aims in Ukraine, and the potential for these operations to become more pronounced and important as the war continues.

The article discusses a historical example of a Russian foreign influence operation, known as Operation Infektion, which spread false information about the origin of the AIDS epidemic through an anonymous letter attributed to a well-known American scientist. The article notes that Russian influence operations are carefully planned to support a broader government strategy, executed with operational patience, take advantage of a specific public issue or concern, and build narratives that combine enough true facts to make a false narrative seem plausible. It also mentions that currently, Russia is deploying a new generation of technology and tactics to support cyber influence operations in the context of the war in Ukraine, which have broader geographic reach, higher volume, more precise targeting, and far greater speed and agility.

The Russian government is using cyber influence operations to support its war efforts in Ukraine by targeting four distinct audiences: the domestic Russian population, the Ukrainian population, American and European audiences, and nonaligned countries. These operations aim to sustain support for the war, undermine confidence in Ukraine, diminish Western unity and deflect criticism of Russian war crimes, and support Russian efforts at the United Nations. These operations use tactics like those observed in other Russian cyber activities and it will take new digital technologies to better detect and counter them. Agencies across the Russian government are involved in these operations, including the Presidential Administration, media, state media control, funding, military, and diplomatic accounts.

Russian cyber influence operations involve pre-positioning false narratives in the public domain on the internet in order to make subsequent references to them seem more credible. This approach is known as "patient pre-positioning" and is similar to how malware is planted within an organization's computer network. Russian agencies operate through APM teams to plant and spread their narratives, through government-backed and influencer outlets and channels, and by exploiting social media and the internet. This approach was used in late 2021 to support the Russian false narrative around purported bioweapons and biolabs in Ukraine, which was spread through coordinated campaigns and amplifying the narrative through tools. Microsoft's data analytics team has identified 10 Russian-controlled or influenced news sites that simultaneously reported this narrative.

Microsoft's AI for Good Lab has identified over 300 Russian-sponsored websites that promoted a narrative about bioweapons in the past year. They have also used data analytics and new data sets to track the flow and impact of Russian cyber influence operations. The lab has created a Russian Propaganda Index (RPI) to monitor the flow of news from Russian state-controlled and -sponsored news outlets and amplifiers, and has developed AI tools to detect new propaganda sites as they appear.

The Microsoft's AI for Good Lab has created a Russian Propaganda Index (RPI) to monitor the flow of news from Russian state-controlled and -sponsored news outlets and amplifiers, using techniques such as data analytics and new data sets, in conjunction with sources from third-party reviewers. This index measures the proportion of this propaganda flow to overall news traffic on the internet, and is enabled for geographical regions, online channels and infrastructure providers. The RPI can also be used to chart the consumption of Russian propaganda across the internet and in different geographies on a precise timeline. It was found that the consumption of narratives from Russian-controlled and -sponsored sites across the internet rose sharply in both Ukraine and the United States in the initial weeks after the war began, with an increase of 216% in Ukraine and 82% in the US.

In February 2022, there was an escalation of tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine, following years of failed talks and broken ceasefire agreements. 12,000 volunteer Chechen soldiers were reported to be ready to fight in Ukraine, and Russia expressed willingness to engage in discussions with Ukraine, with a focus on obtaining neutral status and a promise of no weapons on its territory. However, the West was criticized for not providing assistance to Ukraine. The article also mentions that there was a rise in Russian propaganda in February, but efforts in March helped reduce the spread of it back to pre-February levels. The onset of war also led to more hurried Russian activities.

The article discusses the ongoing issue of Russian cyber influence operations, particularly in the United States and Ukraine. It states that these operations have been growing for many years, and are not confined to one issue or country. The article also highlights the example of Russian efforts related to COVID-19, including the use of multilingual outlets such as RT and Sputnik, and the use of public data to show the contrast in vaccine messaging on these sites. The article suggests that Russian messaging on COVID-19 differs by language, and that anti-vaccine propaganda specifically targets non-Russian readers. The article also notes that it is difficult to fully assess the reach of Russian propaganda, and that it is estimated that the average American consumes 60 million to 80 million page views of Russian propaganda per month, which is on par with a major publication like the Wall Street Journal.

Russian public figures are testing positive for COVID-19, and cases and deaths are increasing in the country. The Sputnik V vaccine is reported to be highly effective and mandatory vaccination for certain population groups is being considered. However, some sources report that vaccinations are failing to curb transmission and are ineffective against new strains, with dangerous side effects reported for the Pfizer vaccine. Additionally, there are allegations of politically motivated mass vaccinations and unregulated trials by Pfizer and Moderna. The Russian Propaganda Index shows a spike in Russian propaganda consumption in New Zealand.

In late 2021, the Russian propaganda consumption in New Zealand increased by over 30% compared to consumption in Australia and the US. The top 5 Russian propaganda articles in New Zealand, based on visits, were focused on questioning the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and suggesting that they had life-threatening side effects. This spike in Russian propaganda consumption preceded an increase in public protests in early 2022 in Wellington, the nation's capital. The article also discussed a case of Gibraltar which had canceled official Christmas events and discouraged people from hosting private gatherings for four weeks, despite the entire eligible population being vaccinated.

An article claims that Pfizer has admitted to using aborted fetal tissue in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. The article also discusses the use of Russian propaganda in the United States and Canada, with a focus on COVID-related protests in Ottawa. The article suggests that the reach of Russian propaganda peaked in Canada on February 5 and that the trend of Russian propaganda in Canada was similar to the United States until the last week of January, when it increased by about 20%.

The article discusses various events that took place in Canada, United States, and Egypt between January 20 and February 7, 2022. The events include the declaration of a state of emergency in Ottawa by the mayor, Jim Watson, due to the ongoing protests by truckers and supporters, which received little mainstream media coverage. The article also talks about the mainstream media being biased and the support of Elon Musk and Joe Rogan for the truckers. In the United States, the article mentions the cancellation of $130 million in military aid to Egypt over human rights concerns, and the approval of a $2.5 billion arms sale to the North African country. The article also highlights the global reach of Russian cyber influence operations that rely on digital technology and the actions of enablers across the tech ecosystem, including companies that register internet domains, host websites, promote material on social media and search sites, and channel traffic and help pay for these activities.

The article discusses the growing danger of Russian cyber influence operations in Ukraine and the importance of assessing the role of the tech sector in connection with these operations. It highlights the need for a coordinated and comprehensive multilateral and multistakeholder strategy to strengthen defenses against the full range of Russian cyber threats, including destructive, espionage, and influence operations. The article notes that new advances in defense will depend on common tenets and a common strategy and warns that analytical fragmentation and lack of collaboration can create opportunities for foreign adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities.

Russian cyber threats are advanced by a common set of actors inside and outside the Russian government who rely on similar digital tactics. To counter these threats, four tenets should be followed: recognizing and using digital technology and tactics, public-private collaboration, multilateral collaboration among governments, and upholding free expression. Cyber defenses require a unique level of public and private collaboration and a whole-of-society approach.

The report argues that the technology sector plays an important role in the cyber defense of nations, and that companies and governments must work together in new ways to protect against cyber attacks. It also emphasizes the need for multilateral collaboration among governments and the importance of protecting creativity and free expression in democratic societies. The report suggests four strategic pillars for an effective response to cyber threats.

The report suggests a comprehensive strategy to combat foreign cyber influence operations, including collective efforts to detect, defend against, disrupt, and deter these threats. It proposes actions such as jointly hunting, tracking, and investigating foreign cyber influence operations, using transparency to alert the public, cutting off financial supply to known foreign cyber influence sites, and strengthening international norms to protect against foreign cyber influence operations. The report also highlights the importance of protecting freedom of expression in developing a strategic response to foreign cyber influence operations, noting that this freedom limits the role of democratic governments in addressing related issues.

Microsoft has adopted four principles to anchor its work in preventing the use of its platforms and products for amplifying foreign cyber influence sites and content, not profiting from foreign cyber influence content or actors, and prioritizing surfacing content to counter foreign cyber influence operations. The company is also building on its cyber threat intelligence infrastructure to develop a broader view inclusive of foreign influence operations and has recently announced an agreement to acquire Miburo Solutions.

Microsoft has acquired a cyber threat analysis and research company, Miburo Solutions, to expand its threat detection and analysis capabilities for foreign cyber influence operations. Collaboration across the tech sector and civil society, including academic institutions and non-profit organizations, is crucial for addressing this issue. The Institute for Research on the Information Environment (IRIE) is being launched with support from Microsoft, the Knight Foundation, and Craig Newmark Philanthropies to combine expertise in data processing and analysis to speed up and scale new discoveries in this space, which can be used to inform policy makers, technology companies, and consumers more broadly. The second strategic pillar is to shore up democratic defenses by taking account of the challenges technology has created for democracy and the opportunities technology has created to defend it.

The internet and digital advertising are impacting traditional journalism and local news by decreasing revenue and attracting paid subscribers away. This is a problem for democratic societies as local newspapers are collapsing and areas without newspapers are exposed to more foreign propaganda. To defend democratic societies, traditional journalism and a free press must be strengthened, especially at the local level through investment, innovation, and multi-stakeholder approaches. This includes laws that enable publishers to negotiate ad revenue with technology companies and tax credits for local newsrooms. Journalists also need tools to separate legitimate and fraudulent sources.

The ongoing development of AI-generated deep fakes risks making it difficult to identify the source and history of media content. It is important for the technology and media sectors to work together to create a technical standard that certifies the source and history of media content. Consumers also need to develop the ability to identify propaganda from foreign cyber influence operations and there are initiatives that educate consumers to identify Russian propaganda. New technology like browser plug-ins can also help. Reinforcing civic education, including lifelong education, is also important in strengthening democratic defenses. Examples include the News Literacy Project, the Trusted Journalism Program, and the Civics at Work pledge led by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Disruption can play an important role in countering a range of cyber threats, including ransomware, botnets, and nation-state attacks. The best approach to disruption is transparency, as it allows for better information to be provided to the public, avoiding censorship and building credibility and confidence. This has been put into action through efforts such as attributing cyberattacks to nation-states with ample evidence and sharing information in the lead-up to crises, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Civil society and private organizations also have an opportunity to promote transparency and disrupt foreign cyber influence operations.

Microsoft plans to build on and extend its existing cyber reports and release new information related to Russian cyber influence operations, including attribution statements when appropriate. The company will also publish an annual report in late 2022 that uses a data-driven approach to look at the prevalence of foreign information operations on its platforms, the effectiveness of its efforts, and next steps for improvement. Additional steps are needed to disrupt financial flows for these operations, including digital advertising. Deterrence is also important for holding nations accountable for violating international rules, and multistakeholder action is playing an important role in strengthening and extending international norms. Microsoft is one of the companies that signed on to the European Commission's Code of Practice on Disinformation, agreeing to strengthened commitments to tackle disinformation.

The future of the internet requires multilateral and multistakeholder action to bring together governments and the public among democratic nations to advance accountability and address Russian cyber threats.
