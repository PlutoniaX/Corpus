This paper is about distribution system resilience, an emerging topic of interest due to the increasing number of extreme events and adverse impacts on the power grid. The concept of resilience poses serious challenges to the power system research community given varied definitions and multivariate factors affecting resilience. The paper provides a detailed overview of distribution system resilience, including classification, assessment, metrics for measuring resilience, possible methods for enabling resilience, and the associated challenges. A new multi-dimensional and multi-temporal resilience assessment framework is introduced along with a research roadmap outlining the future of resilience to help the reader conceptualize the theories and research gaps in the area of distribution system cyber-physical resilience.

The process of quantifying the resilience of a system to identified threats involves developing resilience metrics, proposing improvements, and evaluating the improvement strategy. This requires system-specific research and analysis tools. The need for studying resilience stems from the devastating impacts of recent catastrophic events, such as hurricanes and cyber-attacks, on critical services, such as electricity and telecommunication systems, which have a debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health, and safety. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defence define resilience as the ability of a system to support necessary functions with higher probability and shorter periods of reduced capability during stressful conditions and hostile actions. In the context of power distribution systems, resilience is the ability to resist power supply interruptions and recover from damages during unfavourable events.

This study uses the term "threat or event" to refer to high-impact, low-probability or high-impact, low-frequency (HILF) unfavourable events, such as cyber threats. These events are common but have a low probability of causing high-impact cyber-physical events. The power distribution system (PDS) is the most vulnerable stage in the electric power delivery mechanism, and is susceptible to high-impact events that can cause irrecoverable damages to assets. Factors that impact the inherent resilience of the PDS include extreme weather events, the age of the infrastructure, and the increased use of cyber components for automation, monitoring, and control. The PDS serves many critical loads, such as hospitals and communication lines, and disruption can cause serious loss of life and property. Building codes and standards are in place to ensure continuous power supply for life safety purposes, but immediate restoration is mandatory.

The loss of power incurs an enormous economic cost to the local population and the US Department of Energy has identified the economic benefits of grid resilience. The system should have the capability to anticipate and withstand high-impact, low-probability events such as natural storms, cyber attacks, and more while recovering back to its original state. With the effects of climate change increasing the frequency of such events, it is necessary to conduct research in this area to improve resilience metrics. The first step in imparting resilience to a distribution system is the detailed enumeration of all threats that affect the system.

The article discusses methods for assessing and improving the resilience of power distribution systems (PDS) to various types of threats. The first step is to identify the specific threats that affect a particular system and then tailor a solution to improve the system's resilience. This step also helps utilities make a business case to justify investments in resilience improvements. Metrics for system resilience are not as well-defined as reliability metrics. The metrics introduced for resilience include restoration time, cost of operation and recovery, social expense, and outage duration. The article proposes a novel framework for assessing resilience that takes into account the temporal nature of threats and the performance of the system before, during, and after a threat.

The article discusses a proposed framework for assessing the resilience of power distribution systems (PDS) by evaluating how well the system anticipates and prevents threats, withstands and minimizes damage from threats, and quickly recovers with minimal cost. The framework separates impacts, metrics, and strategies temporally, and takes into account the interconnectedness and complexity of the PDS across multiple domains. The article also notes the need for more inclusive methods of resilience metrics.

The article discusses different classifications of resilience in power distribution systems (PDS) including passive resilience, which is the inherent ability of the PDS to reduce failure through factors that strengthen or isolate intrinsic properties of the system's response to events. Passive resilience is also referred to as infrastructure resilience or planning resilience, which is a costly approach to hardening the existing system against threats. The article also mentions that hardening existing infrastructure is more difficult and expensive than new construction with reduced vulnerabilities to events.

Undergrounding or conversion of overhead lines to underground lines improves system reliability and resilience by removing assets from potential threats. Other methods of infrastructure hardening include elevation of open-air substation structures and equipment, flood and storm protection solutions, and optimised hardening strategies such as selectively upgrading distribution poles and vegetation management. Planning a resilient system is a time and money intensive process that depends on location, vulnerabilities, and threats, and may be constrained by factors such as construction schedule limits, permitting issues, and lack of engineering talent.

Active resilience involves introducing methods to achieve resilience during and after a high-impact low-frequency (HILF) event. It is also known as operational resilience and it is classified into two types: Proactive and Reactive resilience. Proactive resilience refers to taking preventative actions to improve the resilience of the system such as load shedding, islanding, strategic crew deployment, and priming of restoration efforts. Reactive resilience is the action that is taken to restore service after a disruption. Both proactive and reactive resilience depends on the same technology to achieve resilience, such as microgrid formation or islanding. The quantification of active resilience can be performance attributes such as energy not served (ENS) or critical loads not lost.

Islanding techniques are used to detach systems from the grid to prevent cascading outages while maintaining acceptable conditions for serving critical loads. These techniques can be applied to both transmission and distribution systems with distributed energy resources (DERs). Proactive resilience techniques, such as optimal islanding solutions with minimal load shedding, and switch placement algorithms based on a resilience index, can be used to serve critical loads. Reactive resilience refers to the ability of the system to recover quickly after a high impact event with respect to critical loads.

Reactive resilience class deals mainly with distribution system restoration (DSR) and optimal deployment of personnel to repair damaged equipment and feeders. Resilience-based restoration approaches that integrate weather data, field measurements, customer calls, and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) data have been proposed to form a DSR decision support tool. DSR optimization has been proposed using microgrid formation to serve critical loads. During high-impact events, it is important to use all available generation sources and reconfiguration schemes, as seen in studies that used a two-stage restoration procedure, mixed-integer second-order cone programming and maximum coverage problem approach. Human resource resilience is an important factor that affects PDS resilience, including the technical proficiency, training, and availability of the crew, as well as the response plan to the threat. Studies have been conducted on the human element in resilience quantification and implementation, such as the optimal single crew repair sequence.

Crew mobilization and optimal crew routing are important in post-disaster management to minimize repair times and restore power. Studies have used mathematical models to co-optimize repair and restoration efforts, including considering different repair abilities and times among workers, and the impact on local economies. Future research should focus on the economic impact of power disruptions on businesses and industries.

Economic analyses and metrics are needed to study the impact of loss of critical loads and evaluate the economic costs of control and recovery actions for the most economic resilience. Resilience metrics are used to quantify the resilience of the power distribution system (PDS) and justify investments in resilience-driven upgrades and evaluate their efficacy. Resilience can be classified as performance-based, active, and passive, with active resilience achieved through control and automation and passive resilience through system attributes such as hardening, redundancy, and asset spares for repair.

The article discusses economic resilience and strategies for minimizing utility loss during outages, including capital management for high-impact, low-frequency threats, resilience as a service, human resource resilience, optimal crew dispatch for repair and maintenance, resiliency-oriented operator training, provisions for emergency supplies for the crew, threat assessment and response plans, supply chain resilience, inventory control and spares management, and diversification of energy resources. Two categories of resilience metrics are identified: attribute-based metrics that identify power system attributes that affect resilience, and performance-based metrics that describe system functionality during disruptive events.

The article discusses various metrics for measuring the resilience of complex systems, specifically in the power distribution systems (PDS) and how to quantify resilience of multi-dimensional complex systems. It is proposed that it is possible to determine a universal resilience curve that can be used for this purpose. It suggests that a comprehensive metric needs to be developed that takes into account weather-induced failures and cyber-attacks by malicious actors in order to enable operators to make decisions that will improve resilience at the lowest cost. The proposed metrics can be broadly classified into three categories: performance-based metrics for resilience, system characteristic-based resilience using resilience impact factors and cyber metrics.

Power system resilience refers to the ability of a system to predict, prevent, and mitigate threats before they happen, withstand and survive threats when they happen, and recover, restore, and repair itself after a threat. This can be achieved through various methods such as prediction algorithms, proactive reconfiguration schemes, strategic deployment of resources, and hardening of vulnerable assets. Resilience can also be improved during the planning and operational phases through smart investment policies, network reconfiguration, and event-based resilience strategies.

This article discusses various methods of risk mitigation for power systems, such as sump pumps, storm sewer systems, flood monitoring, and elevated construction. It also mentions the importance of cyber resilience and measures such as encryption, access control, and penetration testing. The article introduces the concept of an availability-based engineering resilience metric, represented by a triangle and a graph showing the availability of the system before and after a shock or degradation event. It is an open access article published by the IET under a Creative Commons license.

The resilience of a power system is multi-dimensional and can be evaluated using different metrics. One commonly used metric is the resilience triangle, which considers the pre-event, event, and post-event states. However, this one-dimensional approach is not sufficient for evaluating the multi-dimensional nature of power system resilience. An extension of the resilience triangle is the resilience trapezoid, which takes into account corrective actions and post-event degradation states. The authors propose the E resilience metric system, which measures resilience based on the characteristics of the resilience trapezoid and is divided into three phases: disturbance progress, post disturbance degraded state, and restorative state. This conceptual resilience curve has been used to evaluate resilience enhancement schemes and understand their efficacy before and after an event. The resilience metric system is based on four phases of resilience, also referred to as the 4Rs: robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity.

The resilience of a Power Distribution System (PDS) is defined as the ability to reduce supply discontinuity to critical loads. Critical components in most cases are the loads which are typically ranked in the order of priority based on the function performed by the loads such as life safety loads including hospitals, clinics, and care centers, or public safety loads including police stations, fire stations, military bases, and supporting infrastructure such as communication centers, data centers, and water distribution pump houses. The authors proposed the use of optimal repair time as a resilience indicator that allows for the categorization of loads in the order of the priority of restoration. This measure is post-threat and deals with the recovery of the system. The next evolution of resilience metrics is designed as a multi-objective optimization problem that takes into account various system characteristics based on resilience impact factors.

The work in [4547] introduces the use of multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) to quantify system resilience by taking into account factors such as topological parameters based on graph theory, weather factors, and power system constraints. A framework is presented for using the MCDM technique to compute composite scores for resilience by carefully selecting system factors and assigning appropriate weights based on their impact on resilience. Graph theory-based assessment of resilience is considered the best assessment of the topology of the distribution system, and can be used to evaluate system degradation as a function of geospatial risk. The work proposed in [48] analyses the graph-theoretic metrics of the Korean power grid for resilience analysis, error and attack tolerance, cascading failures, and recovery analysis.

A decision matrix T is formed to evaluate the resilience of a power system to extreme events, using the analytical hierarchical process to determine the relative importance of each term in T and calculating a single resilience metric through the weighted sum of individual metrics. The effect of the extreme event is usually represented in terms of expected energy not supplied (EENS) to determine the fraction of critical loads that are not supplied. Other reliability indices such as ENS, EIU, and loss of expected energy can also be used to capture resilience when applied exclusively to critical loads. Some works also use MCDM techniques like Choquet integral and percolation theory to extend the resilience metric.

The Choquet Integral is used to calculate the resilience score of networks by considering various attributes. The temporal method of resilience evaluation, which includes the factor of time, is useful for operators as it can lead to faster and more impactful decisions. This section focuses on understanding the latest developments in cyber-physical resilience of power systems and lessons learned from recent catastrophic events, such as the cyber-intrusions that occurred in Ukraine leading to a blackout. The system needs to be able to absorb, survive, and recover from these high impact, low-frequency events in order to achieve resilience. The threats to the cyber-physical system are numerous and some common ones are listed in Table 1. Few papers have been published that describe the methodology for devising a resilience metric framework.

A resilience metric framework is proposed by Friedberg et al. [50] based on a vector of performance measures that can be used to predict the resilience of the system through estimation. Clark and Zonouz [52] used a resilience metric that quantifies the cyber-physical intrusion resilience and formulates cyber-defense policies. Wadhawan et al. [53] discussed multiple attacks on various components of smart grids such as fuel distribution systems, DERs, and sensor networks and showed the correlation between the different components and the resilience of the smart grid. Jin et al. [54] presented a novel software-defined networking-based communication network architecture to enhance the cybersecurity and resilience of microgrid operations. The challenges for future research include attaining a working consensus on the definition of resilience for the field.

The standardization of resilience quantification and enabling process is important for measuring a system's ability to anticipate, resist, respond to, adapt to, and recover from disturbances. Different definitions of resilience have been proposed, but there is no consensus, and researchers often choose the definition that supports their proposed problem statement. Resilience metrics need to be developed for utilities to justify future investments and evaluate improvement strategies, but a single unified metric that captures all aspects of a system is impractical due to the number of disruptive events that threaten it. Therefore, the development of multi-domain, event-timeline specific resilience metrics is necessary.

Evaluating resilience indicators, attributes, and performance of a system before, during, and after requires a multi-dimensional analysis to understand the preparedness, robustness, and recovery potential of the system. Threat modeling with multiple infrastructures is necessary as different threats affect different parts of the system. Existing research on threat modeling uses methods such as sequential Monte Carlo analysis and statistical tools to estimate impact and failure probabilities. However, many threats require more explicit description and impact modeling, such as inundation plain maps for flood, tsunami, and avalanche risks. Graph theory analysis of the system can provide a degraded system to which metrics and resilience improvements can be applied.

A direct threat impact model can be used to predict system failure in power distribution systems (PDS), but it is computationally expensive and requires expertise from multiple disciplines. Data-driven techniques such as machine learning can also be used for prediction. However, considering just the impact of the event on the PDS may not be sufficient to compute resilience because of the interconnected nature of the power systems that are dependent on other critical infrastructure for its operation. Leveraging energy storage systems for resilience, such as battery-inverter systems and plug-in electric vehicles, is increasing due to ease of installation and improved control strategies.

The traditional cost-benefit model for installing battery systems may not be economical, but a resilience-oriented business case can be effective. Studies have shown the economic viability of using PV and battery systems, taking outage costs into consideration. Resilience-oriented algorithms, such as a microgrid scheduling algorithm and an energy management system, have been proposed to optimize reserve power during islanded operation of a microgrid. Mobile power systems (MPSs), such as electric vehicle fleets, mobile generators, and mobile electric storage systems, present an opportunity for system restoration during extreme weather events. Optimal resilient routing and scheduling of MPS can enable pre-restoration and increase the survivability of loads.

The condition of a transportation system can greatly affect the effectiveness of restoration strategies during high-impact physical events such as storms and earthquakes. Studies have been done on the use of resilient transportation systems and resilience enhancement strategies, as well as the impact of communication systems during such events. The use of smart devices such as micro-phasor measurement units (PMUs) can provide high granularity situational awareness in distribution grids.

The distribution system has unique challenges for PMU placement, an optimal placement algorithm for PMU can be used to locate for maximum observability from resilience stand-point by identifying the locations that would monitor critical loads, lifeline feeders, and distribution assets. The event detection algorithm applied to the PMU can forecast impending outages and can prescribe proactive control action to the distribution management system to isolate and heal critical sections of the distribution system. PMU can be used for real-time monitoring and event detection, and topology identification which can greatly improve resilience through faster, proactive control schemes in anticipation of a high-impact event.

AMI (Advanced Metering Infrastructure) can improve the resilience of power systems by providing data for faster control actions and validating restoration activity. Emergency demand response can also be implemented using smart meters as a resilience resource. However, the introduction of AMIs also poses a threat of cyber vulnerabilities, which requires further study. Co-simulation tools can be used to analyze the challenges in modelling interdependent cyber-physical systems.

Co-simulation tools are used to analyze the interactions between power systems and communication systems by running multiple simulators together with simultaneous message transfer and time synchronization. These tools, such as GECO and EPOCHS, are mainly used for transmission systems, while others, like FNCS and HELICS, can simulate distribution systems and communication networks. Co-simulation can be used for various resilience use cases, such as studying the effects of communication network characteristics on the transmission network and distribution grid performance. In addition, drones can be used to assess post-disaster damage to the distribution system to optimize recovery efforts by identifying damaged equipment and lines and providing utility workers with knowledge of ground conditions. This area of research is still in its infancy.

This study discusses the use of drone images and wireless sensor networks in identifying potential failures and assessing post-event damage in distribution systems. It presents a mathematical framework for optimizing power system assessment and increasing estimated time of restoration. The study also provides a framework for resilience analysis and reviews existing metrics for resilience in the literature. The goal is to provide a basis for future resilience research and a call for consensus in the definition and approach to enabling resilience.
