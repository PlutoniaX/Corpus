The article discusses the limited role of cyberattacks in the initial stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and explores theories about why that may be the case. It suggests that the limited use of cyberattacks in the conflict challenges conventional wisdom about cybersecurity. The article concludes by arguing that international lawyers should focus on clarifying and enforcing rules for lower-level cyber operations that have proven to be consistently problematic in order to manage escalation risk and prevent future conflicts.

Expectations were high that cyber operations would play a major role in the initial invasion of Russia, but their role appears to have been relatively limited, surprising many experts in the field. Known cybersecurity incidents in the lead up to and following the invasion have been modest in effect, such as a distributed denial of service attack that briefly disrupted access to websites of government departments and banks. Cyber operations have also intermittently disrupted some internet access.

The role of cyber operations in Russia's invasion appears to have been relatively limited, surprising experts. Known incidents have been modest in effect, such as a distributed denial of service attack that briefly disrupted access to websites of government departments and banks. Researchers have also discovered wiper malware on Ukrainian systems, but it caused limited damage. The most significant incident was a cyberattack targeting broadband internet services provided by a US defense contractor, which resulted in a huge loss of communications for Ukraine and disrupted satellite internet access across Europe. There are multiple theories for why cyberattacks have not played a bigger role in the invasion, and the case of Ukraine is expected to become a key study for understanding the role of cyber operations in warfare.

The article discusses possible explanations for limited cyber effects during a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Two options are presented: 1) attempted or planned cyberattacks failed, or 2) Russia chose not to launch widespread cyberattacks. The article suggests that if Russia's cyber operations were less effective than expected, it may be due to the broader picture of the invasion, where Russia failed to achieve its objectives with conventional military forces, possibly due to poor planning and underestimating Ukrainian defenses. The article also mentions reports of specific cyberattacks on Ukrainian banks and telecom companies, as well as a possible sabotage of satellite internet, which are attributed to Russia.

The article discusses hints of defenses against cyber operations that have become publicly known. U.S. officials have noted extensive work to harden Ukraine's networks after Russian attacks in 2015 and 2016, and media reports indicate that U.S. Cyber Command has teams in place to interfere with Russian digital attacks and communications. The article also mentions that defensive experience has paid dividends, allowing authorities to prevent intrusions from causing damage. The U.S. Department of Justice announced the disruption of a Russian government-controlled botnet before it was used, and Ukrainian authorities successfully stopped an in-progress cyberattack by Russia's military intelligence agency before it could cause a blackout. The article also mentions the role of companies like Microsoft and Google in providing actionable intelligence and blocking attacks, as well as the defense that comes from resilience, even in the face of attempted and successful disruptions.

The article discusses the resilience of Ukraine against cyber attacks from Russia. Despite frequent failures in cyber defense, the country has reportedly managed to successfully defend against Russian cyber operations through the use of satellite internet services and focused defense efforts. This success may inspire other countries to increase their own cyber defense efforts. NATO has pledged to continue providing cybersecurity assistance to Ukraine.

The article explores the reasons behind the lack of significant cyberattacks in Ukraine despite ongoing conflict with Russia. Two broad explanations are discussed. The first is the success of Ukraine's defense efforts and the use of satellite internet services. The second is that Russia chose not to deploy cyberattacks for several possible reasons, including a quick victory with conventional forces, fears of cross-border spillover, or the optimal role for cyber operations. The article suggests that the lack of significant cyberattacks in Ukraine may prompt a rethinking of how deterrence operates in cyberspace.

The invasion of Ukraine by Russia did not result in significant cyber-related disruption, despite Russia being a major cyber power. This suggests that even in international armed conflicts, there may not necessarily be a "cyber shock and awe." Instead, lower-level cyber operations that are more consistent and destabilizing are becoming typical in the "gray zone" between peace and open conflict. The Ukraine conflict offers lessons for technical experts, network defenders, international lawyers, and policy makers.

The invasion of Ukraine by Russia did not rely heavily on cyberwarfare, instead, lower-level cyber operations such as brief disruptions to critical infrastructure, DDOS attacks, ransomware, and intrusions into election infrastructure were observed. These operations play to the strengths of cyberattacks, fostering confusion and allowing deniability, and causing long-term loss of trust in digital systems. The Ukraine conflict highlights the blurring of lines between state and non-state actors, with hackers aligning themselves with both sides. The presence of typical gray zone operations, albeit at a heightened rate, is significant in the conflict.

The cyber aspects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict highlight the need for clarification of legal rules for both high-end and gray-zone cyber operations. Currently, there is a greater understanding of the legal framework for major destructive cyberattacks, but more work is needed for gray-zone operations. Issues such as setting rules for operations below the use of force threshold and making existing rules for state responsibility for non-state actors effective in the cyber domain need to be addressed. Clarity on rules for cyber operations can help avoid escalation in conflicts outside of international armed conflicts.

The conflict in Ukraine has seen a full-scale cyberwar emerge, with volunteer hackers and ransomware groups becoming involved. This raises legal questions about state responsibility and highlights the need for clarification of legal rules for cyber operations. Efforts are underway by states, academics, and civil society to clarify the rules for both high-end and gray-zone cyber operations. The legal framework for major destructive cyberattacks is better understood, but more work is needed for gray-zone operations. Clarity on rules for cyber operations can help avoid escalation in conflicts. The consequences of a cyber breach could lead to a real shooting war with a major power, as warned by Biden.
