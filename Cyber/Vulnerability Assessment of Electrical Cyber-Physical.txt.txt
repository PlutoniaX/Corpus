This study analyzes the vulnerability of electrical cyber-physical systems (ECPSs) and proposes a five-aspect method for vulnerability assessment, including robustness, economic costs, degree of damage, vulnerable equipment, and trip point. The study is significant for decision makers to get specific advice and defense strategies for a particular power system. Cyber-physical systems are becoming widespread in critical infrastructure but are vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks. These attacks can cause damage to physical systems or disrupt communication networks and can be achieved through various means, including cyber attacks and physical attacks.

The integration of traditional power grids and modern communication networks into electrical cyber-physical systems (ECPSs) has improved efficiency but also made power systems vulnerable to cyber attacks. Research efforts to study the vulnerability of ECPSs have been conducted based on three approaches, including analyzing the vulnerability caused by safety loopholes from specific cyber attacks such as denial of service and false data injection attacks. Studies have shown that the vulnerability of ECPSs is caused by deceived bad data detection tests and that key real-time operational tools are vulnerable to false data injection attacks. Efforts to improve detection strategies are ongoing.

The authors reviewed three approaches to assess the vulnerability of Electric Cyber-Physical Systems (ECPSs) for attack detection and security enhancement. The first approach uses geometric control theory and random response methods, but they may not be effective for complex situations. The second approach models ECPSs and uses complex network theory to quantify vulnerability, but it only analyzes topological characteristics and not electrical information. The third approach focuses on developing smart grid testbeds for vulnerability analysis, but it requires a cyber-physical power system framework.

The authors' research focuses on establishing a complete evaluation procedure for vulnerability analysis, which includes a model approach suitable for large-scale systems and a comprehensive vulnerability assessment from five aspects.

The article presents a framework for electrical cyber-physical systems (ECPSs) that considers the characteristics of power grids, communication facilities, and their interdependent relationships. The framework models power grids as a graph with power buses and branches, and communication networks as a graph with communication nodes and lines. Each bus or branch in the power grid is equipped with a controller and sensor, creating a highly intelligent smart grid. The framework is introduced in Section 2, with the solution approaches for fault detection, protection procedures, and adjustment strategies presented in Section 3. The aspects of vulnerability assessment and simulation platform are illustrated in Section 4, with examples analyzed using the IEEE 39-bus system in Section 5. The article concludes in Section 6 and discusses future work in Section 7.

This paper discusses the framework of a regional Energy Control and Power System (ECPS) in a smart grid. The framework consists of a communication network and a power grid, where each bus or branch in the power grid is equipped with a controller and a sensor. The regional ECPSs can be divided into several local control centers, which are controlled by centralized or distributed control structures. The Direct Current (DC) power flow model is used to calculate the distribution of power flows and is considered acceptable for estimating the performance of large-scale ECPSs.

This paper focuses on the impacts of Energy Control and Power Systems (ECPSs) under cyber attacks rather than the mechanism of these attacks. The authors use the Direct Current (DC) power flow model to calculate the distribution of power flows in ECPSs and introduce a solution approach for fault detections, protection procedures, and adjustment strategies in the next section. The relationships between communication networks and power grids are defined as the control function.

In this section, the authors propose a method for detecting and protecting against cyber attacks in a power grid system. The method first localizes possible faulty nodes using Algorithm 1, which calculates the shortest distance between nodes and identifies a possible fault set. The protection procedure for the system is then based on the results from Algorithm 1.

This section introduces the protection procedure of ECPSs (Electric Control Power Systems) against cyber attacks. The procedure starts with a tripped branch and involves the following steps: (a) judge the connectivity of the system after cutting off a branch, (b) identify the main area after splitting, (c) upload changed topology and electrical information to the control center, (d) make decisions with unbalanced power, (e) download and adjust control strategies, (f) update topology and electrical information, (g) calculate power flow, (h) search for overloaded branches, and (i) end the procedure and record the loss. An algorithm is used to assess the damage degree of the system in case of an overloading incident.

Algorithms 2 and 3 are used to analyze and address splitting incidents in an electrical power system (ECPS). Algorithm 2 determines the number of areas the system will be separated into and Algorithm 3 identifies the main area after the splitting incident. The control center will then adjust the output of generators in the main area to balance the power distribution in case of unbalanced power due to the splitting incident. The method can be applied in three situations, including the separation of generators.

In the event of a splitting incident in an ECPS, the control center will collect electrical information and adjust the outputs of generators to maintain balance between supply and demand. The adjustment is based on the sum of lost generator outputs (Situation I) or lost loads (Situation II). If both generators and loads are separated, the control center calculates the unbalanced power and adjusts accordingly. The weighted adjustment of each generator is calculated using Algorithm 4, taking into account the proximity to tripped branches. If the adjusted output exceeds the limit, it is modified to the nearest limit.

The Vulnerability Assessment and Simulation Platform in China's electrical communication and power grid systems (ECPSs) is vulnerable to small faults leading to cascading failures due to strong coupling between the power grids and communication networks. The vulnerability is assessed from five aspects including stability, robustness, node constraints, branch capacity limits, and flow direction. The assessment procedure involves cutting off a branch, balancing power supplies and demands, redistributing power flow, and calculating the proportion of remaining buses. The stability and robustness of the system are evaluated based on the number of remaining buses after the procedure.

The Vulnerability Assessment and Simulation Platform in China's electrical communication and power grid systems (ECPSs) assesses the system's vulnerability from five aspects: stability, robustness, vulnerable branches with higher economic costs, vulnerable branches with serious damage, and vulnerable nodes against extra power injection. A MATLAB-based platform is built for offline simulation and analysis of the vulnerability. The system configuration used in the simulation is listed in Table 2, including the operating system, CPU, and other details.

The article describes a MATLAB-based platform for simulating and analyzing the vulnerability of an Electric Cyber-Physical System (ECPS). The platform requires inputting the topology of the power grid, sensor, router, and actuator locations, and protection algorithms. The simulation uses the IEEE 39-bus system as an example and assumes that the sensors, routers, and actuators are located at each bus and branch. The program outputs vulnerability assessments based on simulation results. The system configuration includes a Windows 7/10 or MacOS X 10.11 operating system, Intel Core i7-4790 CPU, 8GB RAM, and MATLAB 2012a software.

The article describes a simulation platform for evaluating the performance of an Electrical Power Control System (ECPS) under different faults. The platform begins with a situation selection where the user randomly selects a power node and sets the amount of power injection. The program then searches for overloaded lines. In another scenario, the user randomly selects a branch as the initial triggering event, causing the ECPS to undergo protection and control procedures. The simulation results are used to assess the vulnerability of the ECPS and provide protection suggestions. In one scenario, the initial power injection is set to 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 PM W. The extra power injection can be successfully injected into a power bus if it is within the capacity limit. When the injection is 250 PM W, almost half of the loads exceed the limit. The results show 8 situations where the extra injection causes an overloading incident and lists the possible fault power nodes.

The article discusses the simulation results of the vulnerability of the Energy Control Power Systems (ECPSs) against power injections. The simulation platform developed in the study assesses the vulnerability and provides protection suggestions. The results show that buses 12, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 28, and 29 are vulnerable against a single power injection, with bus 20 being the most vulnerable. The overloaded branches are also vulnerable to power flow changes due to higher initial load rates or unreasonable partial design of the topology. The branches near the generators have higher capacity limitations with no generator node being vulnerable. This partial design is considered worth learning.

Table 1 shows the efficiency of Algorithm 1 with 90% accuracy in 7 out of 8 overloaded branch situations. Table 3 presents the CASE 1 results with the Extra Injection Node ID and Overloaded Branch. Table 4 presents the CASE 2 results with 20 possible simulation results causing cascading failures, including the initial faulty branch, remaining branches and buses, economic cost, and running time. The superiority of Algorithm 4 is verified by comparing it to the strategy using average adjustments. Figure 5 shows the stability of the system based on the simulation results.

A study was conducted on a power system's stability and vulnerability under faults. Results showed that with a randomly tripped branch, the system is stable 57% of the time, while 43.7% of the time it will suffer a splitting incident with a 31% chance of causing serious cascading failures. The economic costs of protection were also analyzed, showing that using a weighted adjustment strategy is more economical than an average adjustment strategy. However, there were four situations where using the weighted adjustment strategy worsened cascading failures compared to the average adjustment.

A study was conducted on a power system's performance and vulnerability under faults. Results showed that the weighted adjustment strategy is more economical than the average adjustment strategy, but may have a higher probability of causing severe failures if the branches near the tripped power node have a high initial load rate. The economic costs of protection were analyzed and compared for both strategies, with the government paying more for repairing the system if certain branches were cut off at the beginning.

The government will pay more for repairing a system after cascading failures. A weighted adjustment in Algorithm 4 is more economical than an average adjustment, as it can largely ease the degree of severe cascading failures. However, there are four situations in which the weighted adjustment may cause a severe failure if the branches near the tripped power node have a high initial load rate. These limitations are reflected in Figure 6 and 7.

The paper discusses a proposed algorithm for adjusting the power system in order to prevent cascading failures. The algorithm is based on a weighted strategy and is found to be more economical than the average strategy. However, there are four situations where the weighted strategy may cause a severe failure due to high initial load rates of branches near the tripped power node. Figure 7 shows the remaining branches and buses in the system, and figure 8 shows the relationship between the tripping point and cascading failure propagation caused by splitting incidents. The relationship between time and cascading failure propagation is nonlinear and may cause a rapid decrease in size with an increase in loops.
