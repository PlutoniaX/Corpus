In the article "Challenges for Ukraine's Cyber Security: National Dimensions", the author Pavlo Katerynchuk from Chernivtsi National University in Ukraine discusses the growing use of information as a weapon in Russia's foreign and domestic policies. The EU and USA have recognized the powerful influence of Russian media and propaganda, including on electoral processes and the activities of state administration, and the threat it poses to the US and its European allies. Russia's disinformation efforts aim to confuse, daze, and divert citizens from supporting the EU and Ukraine and seeks to undermine support for European values. The article also highlights that Russian advocacy efforts in Europe make up an important part of their hybrid approach to the projection of force, and that Russia carefully and purposefully prepared an information war against Ukraine long before the crisis in Ukraine.

The war in Eastern Ukraine and the information confrontation with the Russian State highlights the need for protecting Ukraine's cyberspace as a crucial aspect of national information security. The annexation of Crimea and invasion of Russian troops in the Donbas region have emphasized the importance of building an effective cyber security system in Ukraine. However, the field of cyberspace research and cyber security analysis is plagued with uncertainties and lacks clear definitions and regulations. Understanding the concept of cyberspace is essential for studying the interconnection between information security and cyber security. The term "cyberspace" was first introduced by science-fiction writer William Gibson in 1982, but various interpretations exist and different countries have their own definitions in their legislation.

The field of cyberspace research and cyber security is characterized by a lack of clear definitions and regulations. Different countries have their own definitions in their legislation, but most definitions boil down to understanding cyber security as a state of cyberspace security of the state as a whole, or of some of its infrastructure against external influences and risks, which ensures their sustainable development, as well as the timely detection, prevention and neutralization of real and potential challenges, cyber interventions and threats to personal, corporate and/or national interests. Russia's hybrid aggression against Ukraine, which began in early 2014, included a wide range of information and psychological influences on the population of Ukraine and Russia, and was aimed at weakening Ukraine.

The Russian Federation has been engaging in a hybrid war against Ukraine, primarily in the information sphere but also in cultural, humanitarian, military, financial, energy, diplomatic, economic, and cyberspace spheres. Cyber aggression is a key component of this outreach. There has been a significant amount of research and publications on the topic of information and cyber security, but the focus has been on general issues rather than on developing a national system of cyber security as an integral element of Ukraine's information security system. The purpose of the article is to study the national dimensions of cyberspace as a component of Ukraine's information security.

Russian cyber threats and possible cyber attacks began to peak during the 2016 US election campaign, where it is believed that Russian hackers intervened and influenced the campaign and electoral sympathies of Americans. However, these were just echoes of a long and purposeful campaign by Russian intelligence services, who increasingly involve cyberspace and electronic media for espionage and undermining the interests of the Kremlin. The US has responded to these attacks by introducing new sanctions against companies and individuals, and the NotPetya virus attack on power distribution networks in 2018 was named a part of the Kremlin's efforts to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. Russia denies involvement in the attack and argues that Russian companies have also been affected by it.

In 2017, a virus known as "Petya" affected computers and demanded money for restoring access to locked programs. British Prime Minister Theresa May blamed President Putin for trying to sow discord in the West through interference in elections and cyberwarfare. American and British officials also reported that the virus affected a wide range of organizations including internet service providers, private businesses, and critical infrastructure providers. In 2018, German officials also accused Russia of hacking attacks on government sites, specifically the German Foreign and Defence Ministries, and NATO has adopted a consolidated stance against these cyber attacks.

The Warsaw Summit Communiqué of 2016 identified Russia's destabilizing role in the world, including its illegal annexation of Crimea and violations of sovereign borders, as well as aggressive nuclear rhetoric and violations of NATO allied airspace. The Communiqué also acknowledged cyber attacks as a clear challenge to NATO security and recognized the need for cyber defense to be integrated into NATO's core tasks of collective defense. Additionally, the Communiqué acknowledged that Russia's attempts to control media and cyber attacks on Western powers were just the tip of the iceberg and that Ukraine was a main target for cyber crime and attacks by Russia.

Purposeful cyber attacks against Ukraine began in March 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and pro-Russian hacktivist group CyberBerkut began carrying out massive DDoS attacks on the Ukrainian government and corporate websites. From 2014-2017, about 6,000 hacker attacks were committed against Ukraine. The most powerful attack occurred on June 27, 2017, using the Petya malware, which targeted Ukrainian organizations and spread to other countries. Experts believe the attack was designed to cause maximum damage, with Ukraine being the main target. The cyber attack used a modified version of the Petya ransomware, which exploited the EternalBlue exploit found in older versions of Microsoft Windows.

The version of Petya malware used in the Ukraine cyber attacks had been modified and was named NotPetya or Nyetna. NotPetya encrypted all files on the infected computers and in some cases the computers files were completely wiped or rewritten in a manner that could not be undone through decryption. The software also exploited the Server Message Block protocol in Windows to infect local computers on the same network, and any remote computers it could find. Security experts noted that the software could intercept passwords, perform administrator-level actions that could further ruin computer files, and it could identify specific computer systems to bypass infection, suggesting the attack was more surgical in its goal. There was no kill switch as there was with WannaCry software, which would immediately stop its spread.

A ransomware attack occurred on the eve of a Ukrainian holiday, with the attackers demanding payment in Bitcoin and claiming that files could be easily recovered. However, some experts believed the malware also wiped affected hard drives. The attack took place while most government offices were closed, allowing it to spread without interference. A government adviser suggested the attack may be related to the assassination of an intelligence officer in Kiev. The Ukrainian Security Service later claimed the equipment used in the attack belonged to Russian agents and that the same group was responsible for a previous attack on Ukrainian infrastructure in 2016. Ukraine sees this as part of a larger Russian hybrid war on the country.

The United States Central Intelligence Agency and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence have accused Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of being behind the NotPetya cyber attack that affected systems in Ukraine, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Russia denied involvement and pointed out that Russian systems were also impacted by the attack. Ukraine responded by strengthening the role of its Department of Cyber Police and increasing its resources. The country also accelerated the adoption of a law on the protection of cyberspace which came into force in May 2018. This law sets the legal and organizational foundations for ensuring the protection of the country's cyberspace.

The legislation in Ukraine lays out the main goals, directions, and principles of state policy in the field of cyber security, as well as the powers of state bodies, enterprises, and individuals in this area. It defines cyberspace as a virtual environment for communication and social relations formed by connected communication systems and electronic communications using the internet. Cyber defense is defined as a set of measures to prevent, detect, and protect against cyber attacks and restore the functioning of communication and technology systems. The main subjects of the national system of cyber security in Ukraine include government agencies such as the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection, the National Police, and the Ministry of Defense. The law also identifies critical infrastructure objects such as economic, energy, transportation, and communication industries as important for cyber security.

The Ukrainian authorities have taken steps to protect national cyberspace by enacting laws and creating the Department of Cyber police. However, cyber attacks on Ukraine remain a threat, despite these efforts. The US Justice Department recently reported breaking up a potential cyber attack called VPN Filter, which affected half a million internet routers in Ukraine and 54 other countries, and was believed to be carried out by the Russian hacking group, Sofacy Group (also known as Fancy Bear). The study of cyberspace as a component of Ukraine's information security highlights the lack of attention given to cyber security and cyberspace in Ukraine for the past 20 years, but recent events have made it clear that it is an important issue that requires attention.

In spring 2014, Russia conducted special operations to annex Crimea and facilitate war in Donbas, with a significant portion of the campaign consisting of cyber attacks carried out by Russian hackers. These attacks aimed to paralyze government agencies and influence public opinion in Ukraine. As a result, Ukraine suffered significant losses and began to prioritize cyber security as a component of national security, leading to the creation of a cyber police department and the strengthening of public defense for the protection of domestic cyberspace. Ukraine is currently rethinking the role of cyber security and forming a national system to protect against cyber threats.

The article discusses various cyber-attacks on Ukraine, with experts saying that the attacks were focused on data rather than money. The FBI and other organizations have attempted to thwart potential attacks and several countries, including the US and UK, have blamed Russia for these cyber attacks. The article also mentions the challenges faced by Ukraine in terms of cyber security and mentions a specific incident in Kiev where the West failed to protect Ukraine from cyber attacks.

The Washington Post reported in 2017 that a killing in Kiev showed how the West continues to fail Ukraine. In 2018, the CIA concluded that the Russian military was behind the NotPetya cyberattack in Ukraine. The National Military Strategy of the United States of America stated that cyber attacks are a threat to national security. Ukraine has accused Russia of cyber attacks on government networks, and has developed a strategy for cyber security. The President of Ukraine has approved a strategy for cyber security, and there is a law in place in Ukraine for the basic principles of ensuring cyber security.

The sources discuss various instances of cyber attacks on Ukraine, with many accusing Russia of being behind them. The CIA and British government have also accused Russia of being behind a specific cyber attack known as NotPetya. Ukraine has also established a strategy for cybersecurity and laws to protect against cyber attacks. The North Atlantic Council has also addressed the issue of cyber attacks in a communique from their 2016 summit in Warsaw.
